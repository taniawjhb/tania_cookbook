KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN
For the chicken:
8 chicken breasts
1 teaspoons salt
pinch black pepper (or to taste)
1 teaspoon grated ginger
4-5 cups oil for frying about 2-inch deep (use deep, 
bottom heavy, medium size pot or pan)
For the wet batter option
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder.
1/4 cup potato starch (or cornstarch)
3/4 cup water
For the red spicy sauce
2 tablespoons grated onion
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon finely grated ginger
1 tablespoon soy sauce
4 tablespoons rice wine (or mirin)
2 - 3 tablespoons hot sauce like Siracha
4 tablespoons chili sauce or ketchup
2 tablespoons gochujang
2 tablespoons corn syrup or honey
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon sesame oil
Instructions:
Step 1:  Wash chicken wings, and drain thoroughly. 
Mix with the salt, pepper, and ginger. Let it sit in the 
fridge for 2 hours or longer (overnight to 24 hours).
Step 2:  Mix the wet batter ingredients in a bowl, 
and stir well until smooth with no visible lumps.
Step 3:  Add the oil to a deep fryer, wok, or large 
pot. Heat the oil to 320째F (up to 330째F). Drop the 
chicken in the oil, one piece at a time. If using wet 
batter, dip each piece in the wet batter with tongs 
and shake off excess batter before dropping the 
chicken in the oil. Fry them in two batches. Cook 
until lightly golden, about 6 minutes, depending on 
the size of the chicken wings. Remove them with a 
wire skimmer or a slotted spoon. Drain on a wire 
rack or in a large mesh strainer set on a bowl.
Step 4:  Reheat the oil to 350째F (up to 360째F). Add 
the chicken (you can do this in one batch for the 
second frying), and deep fry again, for about 5 
minutes, until golden brown. Drain on a wire rack or 
in a large mesh strainer set on a bowl.
Step 5:  You can either toss the fried chicken pieces 
in the sauce or hand-brush them. Sprinkle with the 
optional sesame seeds or chopped scallion to 
serve.
RED SAUCE RECIPE:  Add 1 tablespoon of cooking 
oil and then the onion, garlic, and ginger. Stir for a 
minute until fragrant. Add all other sauce 
ingredients, and stir well. Simmer until it thickens 
slightly, about 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the heat off. The 
sauce will get slightly thicker as it cools down.
