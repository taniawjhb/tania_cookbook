Green Curry Paste
9 small green chillies
1 slice galangal/ ginger (or both)
2/3 of a stalk of lemon grass
peel of 2 limes
1.5 shallots/small red onions
2 clove garlic
1 slice of turmeric/ 1 tsp dry turmeric
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp shrimp paste
Start by finely chopping all the ingredients, as much as possible. Then add them to a heavy stoned
mortar and grind until a smooth paste is formed and all the aromas have been released.
Curry pastes can be stored in the fridge in a clean container for 7-10 days - but they are best fresh.
