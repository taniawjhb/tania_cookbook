<h1>Guacamole</h1>

The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.
Guacamole
6 ripe avocados
3 limes, juiced
1 medium yellow onion, chopped
2 serrano chiles, cut into rounds
1 big handful fresh cilantro with stems, about 1/2 cup, finely chopped
Extra-virgin olive oil
Coarse salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Halve and pit the avocados. With a tablespoon, scoop out the flesh into a mixing bowl. Mash the avocados using either a
fork or potato masher, leaving them still a bit chunky.
Add the remaining ingredients, and fold everything together. Drizzle with a little olive oil, adjust seasoning with salt and
pepper and give it 1 final mix with a fork.
Lay a piece of plastic wrap tight on the surface of the guacamole so it doesn't brown and refrigerate for at least 1 hour
before serving.
