ORANGE & CARDAMOM FRENCH TOAST
WITH VANILLA STRAWBERRIES
1 1/2 cups whole milk
4 large eggs
1 tablespoon light brown sugar
1 teaspoon lightly packed orange zest
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
8 (1-inch thick) slices sweet batard or brioche
3 or 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 tablespoon honey
1 sachet vanilla sugar
1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
1 pound strawberries, hulled, and halved lengthwise
In a large bowl, whisk together milk, eggs, sugar, orange zest, vanilla, cardamom, and salt until eggs are broken
up and evenly combined. Soak 3 bread slices in egg mixture turning once, until soaked through,
Meanwhile, melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large frying pan over medium heat. When butter foams, place 3
pieces soaked bread in the pan and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining
bread. Serve topped with Honeyed Strawberries.
Mix honey, vanilla sugar, and orange juice together in a medium bowl until honey is dissolved. Add strawberries,
stir to coat, and let sit until berries give off their juices, at least 5 minutes. Stir briefly before using.
