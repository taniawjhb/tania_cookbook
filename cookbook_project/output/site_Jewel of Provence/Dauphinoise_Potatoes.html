Dauphinoise Potatoes
3 lbs waxy potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
180gms gruyere cheese, grated
3‚ÅÑ4 pint double cream
salt
fresh ground black pepper
2 -4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
2 sprigs fresh thyme
1 ounce butter
Preheat the oven to 300F/150C/gas mark 2.
Take a heavy-bottomed dish or an ovenproof gratin dish (a Le Creuset is ideal - the potatoes tend not to catch),
and grease it will with some of the butter.
Layer the potato slices in the dish, slightly overlapping each other, seasoning lightly with the salt and pepper, and
sprinkling a liberal amount of cheese on each layer.
Sprinkle cheese on the top of the last layer.
Put the double cream, garlic and sprigs of thyme in a pan and bring to them gently to the boil, then remove the
thyme and pour hot cream over the potatoes.
Dot the top of the gratin with the remaining butter and some extra cheese if you wish, and bake for about 1 hr to
1 1/2 hrs, or until the potatoes are soft, and the top is crispy and golden brown.
Serve bubbling hot as a main meal or as an accomniment.
