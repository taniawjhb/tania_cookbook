ROAST CHICKEN & ROSEMARY 
ANCHOVY BUTTER
1 lemon, cut into wedges
1 onion, cut into wedges
2 garlic cloves
4 sprigs rosemary
1 free-range chicken, around 1.5kg
300ml white wine
2tbsp cornflour mixed with 2tbsp cold water
For The Anchovy Butter: 125g butter
2tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
2tbsp rosemary leaves
2 garlic cloves
50g tin anchovies in oil, drained
Zest and juice ½ lemon
To make the anchovy butter, put the butter into a heatproof 
bowl and microwave on high for 10 seconds, to soften 
slightly. Put the parsley, rosemary and garlic in a processor 
and whizz to finely chop. Add the anchovies, lemon zest 
and juice and whizz to combine. Add the butter and blend 
again.
Heat the oven to 200 C. Push the lemon and onion 
wedges, garlic and rosemary inside the chicken cavity.
Lift up the loose chicken skin at the neck, and ease your 
fingers between the skin and chicken breast. Spoon in half 
the anchovy butter. Tuck the loose skin under the wing 
tips, to secure.
Put the chicken into a roasting tin, and rub the rest of the 
anchovy butter over the top and sides. Pour in 450ml 
water and roast for 45 minutes. Baste, add the wine and 
roast for a further 30 minutes. Insert a skewer into the 
thickest part of the chicken – it’s ready when the juices run 
clear. Put the chicken onto a serving plate and cover with 
foil to rest.
To make the gravy, put the roasting tin directly onto the 
hob and heat with the cornflour mixture. Whisk to thicken, 
directly on hob. Carve the chicken and serve with the gravy 
and vegetables.
