Instructions
For the whipped feta
Step 1: In the bowl of a large food processor fitted with a 
blade, combine the feta, Greek yogurt and lemon zest. Blend, 
and while the processor is running, drizzle olive oil through the 
top opening, until the feta is whipped to a smooth mixture.
Step 2:  Transfer the whipped feta to a serving plate. With the 
back of your spoon, smooth the top of the feta, making an 
indentation in the middle (or a “well”). Pour a bit of olive oil all 
over the feta, then top with your sesame spice topping.
For the spice topping
Step 1: Warm a frying pan over a medium heat, then add your 
sesame seeds, stir continuosly, being careful not to let any 
burn, until the sesame seeds are fragrant and tosted.
Step 2:  Transfer the sesame seeds to a bowl and add the 
other ingredients, stir to combine and set aside, and use to 
top your whipped feta. 
For the pita chips
Step 1: Warm your pita for 20 seconds in the microwave to 
help them loosen up, then slice in half through the pita.  Now 
cut the pita into 12 or so chips (as you would a pizza)
Step 2:  Add the olive oil, spices and salt to a bowl, stir to 
combine, then add the pita chips and gently toss them to coat 
with the seasoning, being careful not to break them.
Step 3: Place the pita chips in a single layer and bake in a hot 
oven, 220C on the middle wrack, turning once or twice, until 
golden and crunchy. Keep and eye on them as they can burn 
easily.
