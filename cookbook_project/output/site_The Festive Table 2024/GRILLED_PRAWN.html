INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Place all the ingredients for the prawns into a bowl 
and mix to combine.  Now add the prawns  and toss well to 
coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. 
Transfer the bowl to room temperature and let sit for 10 
minutes before grilling.
Step 2:  Meanwhile, heat the grill over high heat. Coat the 
jalapeño and pineapple slices with a drizzle of oil and a 
pinch of salt. Grill both for a few minutes until charred on all 
sides and tender. Remove from the grill. Peel the jalapeno and 
remove the stem. Chop it finely. Dice the pineapple, removing 
any hard core sections.
Step 3:  In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the lime juice, 
lime zest, red wine vinegar, honey, and garlic. Drizzle in the 
olive oil, whisking continuously. Stir in the jalapeño. Season 
with a pinch of salt to taste. Set aside.
Step 4:  When the prawns are ready, place them onto the grill 
and cook for a couple of minutes on each side until charred 
and pink. Allow to cool for a few minutes before assembling 
the salad.
Step 5:   Add the rocket, cherry tomatoes, avocado, radish, 
basil, pineapple, and prawns to the bowl of vinaigrette. Toss 
well. Taste and season with more salt if needed. Serve 
immediately.
