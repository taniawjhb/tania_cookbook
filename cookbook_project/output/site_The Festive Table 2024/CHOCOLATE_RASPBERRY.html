CHOCOLATE & RASPBERRY 
ROULADE
150g plain chocolate with 60% cocoa solids 
TR6 medium eggs, separated
150g caster sugar plus a little for sprinkling
450ml double cream
3 tbsp icing sugar 350g 
raspberries
icing sugar to dust cocoa powder to dust
Grease a nonstick baking paper and line a 23x33 cm Swiss roll 
tin. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C
.
Melt the chocolate over a pan of gently simmering water.
Place the egg whites in a large grease-free bowl and using an 
electric whisk, whisk them until they form soft peaks. Set aside.
Place the egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl and stand it over 
a pan of simmering water. Whisk until the eggs are fluffy and 
thick enough to leave a trail when the whisk heads are lifted 
from the mixture. Stir in the chocolate then gently fold in the egg 
whites.
Pour into the prepared tin and bake for 20-25 mins or until the 
centre springs back when lightly touched with your finger.
Whilst the cake cooks, lay a sheet of nonstick baking paper out 
on the work surface and sprinkle with a little caster sugar. Tip the 
roulade out onto the paper, carefully peel away the lining paper, 
trim the edges then cover the roulade with a clean, damp tea 
towel. Leave to cool.
Whip the cream and icing sugar until it forms soft peaks, gently 
fold in half the raspberries. Spread the cream mixture over the 
roulade, scatter over the remaining raspberries.
Then starting from one of the narrow ends, carefully roll up the 
roulade using the paper to help. Transfer to a serving plate and 
dust with a mixture of icing sugar and cocoa.
