<h1>AVOCADO & CORN SALAD</h1>
<pre>
INGREDIENTS
3 cups cooked corn, about 3 medium/ large 
ears of corn
1 red bell pepper
1 can of black beans, rinsed and drained
2 avocados, not overly ripe
¼ cup red onion
1 Jalapeño , optional
4 tbsp fresh cilantro
Dressing
¼ cup fresh lime juice, 
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
3 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp honey,
1 tsp smoked paprika
¾ tsp kosher salt
¼ tsp pepper
¼ tsp garlic powder
2 tbsp fresh cilantro , optional for dressing
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  If the corn is frozen, thaw it according to the package. 
I prefer it fresh off the cob for extra crunch.  If using fresh corn 
on the cob, peel and shuck it.
Step 2:   Mix up all the dressing ingredients in a small bowl, 
apple cider vinegar, oil, seasoning, chopped cilantro, honey, 
lime juice. Give it a taste and adjust as needed.
Step 3:  Chop up the jalapeño, red bell pepper, avocado, 
onion, and cilantro into bite sized pieces. Try to keep 
everything close in size to a piece of corn.
Step 4:  With a sharp knife and steady hand, place the corn 
cob on a non slip cutting board vertically and use the knife to 
slice all the corn kernels off in a downward direction. Gently 
separate the kernels if they are all stuck together, some stuck 
together is okay, and looks beautiful in the salad.
Step 5:  Assemble salad by adding all the ingredients 
together, peppers, onion, black beans, cilantro, jalapeño, 
avocado and pour dressing over the salad. Toss well, serve.
