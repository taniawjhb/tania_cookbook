Ingredients
1 cup chopped coriander leaves (cilantro), 
tightly packed – 50 grams
2 teaspoons chopped green chillies or 2 to 3 
green chillies or as needed
1 chopped ginger or 1 inch ginger
½ teaspoon roasted cumin powder or 
ground cumin – optional

salt
1 to 2 tablespoons water
Method
In a blender or chutney grinder, add the chopped coriander 
leaves, chopped ginger and green chillies.  If you add the 
full amount of chilli it makes for a spicy green chutney. If you  
cannot tolerate spicy food, add ½ to 1 teaspoon of chopped 
green chillies.
Add lemon juice, roasted cumin powder or ground cumin, 
black salt and pink salt, table salt or sea salt as required. 
Add water and blend or grind all the ingredients until 
smooth. Taste the chutney and add more salt or lemon juice 
if needed.
Store the cilantro chutney in a covered bowl or container in 
the refrigerator.  Use the chutney as required.
