1 cup ricotta
2tbsp grated Parmesean
2tsp fresh chopped chives
1tbsp fresh chopped flat-leaf parsley (Italian Parsley)
2tsp fresh chopped basil
1tsp fresh chopped thyme
200g butter
12 fresh Sage leaves
Mix the ingredients for your filling, and season with salt/pepper. Taste to see saltiness.
Take a pasta sheet, and gently fold along its midline to make a crease, then re-open it.
Keeping your spacing at about 3 cm, place 1 tbsp of your filling at a time along the bottom half of your sheet
Lightly moisten the ouside edges of your sheet using a little water on a pastry brush
Fold it over along the earlier crease. Press from the folded point outwards to remove any excess air
Gently pat the dough down around each filling to create a seal.
Finally use a pasta cutter to cut your ravioli into squares.
- Panzarotti
Take your pasta sheet, and using the floured rim of a water glass, make discs along your sheet. Remove excess
pasta. Place a ball of filling in the center of the disc,
Brush outside edges with very little water and then gently fold in half, trying to remove as much air as possible
when doing so.
Use a fork to crimp the edges and form a seal. Plunge into rapidly boiling, salted water, for 3-4 minutes
