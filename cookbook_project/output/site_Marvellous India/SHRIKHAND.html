SHRIKHAND
Ingredients
For the Shrikhand
1½ cups thick greek yogurt
1 pinch saffron strands 
¼ to ½ tsp green cardamom powder
(3 to 4 cardamom pods)
¼ cup sugar - powdered (use as needed)
2 tbsps almonds, chopped
1 tbsps pista, chopped
Method
For the Syrup
1. Place a colander or strainer over a large tall bowl to 
collect the whey. Spread a clean muslin or cheese cloth over 
the strainer.
2. Add curd to the cloth. Bring all the edges together. 
Squeeze out the excess whey from the curd.
3. Wrap the curd in the cloth and tie it with one of the edges 
to make a knot.
4. Place the bundle of yogurt over the strainer/ colander with 
the tall bowl beneath. Place an heavy object over the yogurt 
so all of the whey drains to the bowl beneath. Ensure the 
colander does not touch the drained whey in the bowl.
5. Transfer this to the refrigerator.  leave it in the fridge 15 to 
18 hours. 
For the Shrikhand
1. Drained super thick hung curd or chakka will be ready 
after the whey has been drained completely.
2. Soak saffron in 1 tbsp hot water or hot milk.
3. Powder the sugar and set aside. If you do not have 
cardamom powder, add the cardamom pods to the grinder 
along with sugar and grind to a fine powder.
4. Remove strained yogurt/ chakka from the cloth and 
transfer to a mixing bowl. Most of the whey would have 
been drained. Save this for later use, you can use it to make 
roti dough, bread dough or pancake batter.
5. Add saffron infused milk, powdered sugar and 
cardamom powder.
6. Whisk it well with a metal whisk until really smooth. 
7. Serve shrikhand with puri or chill and enjoy as a dessert.
8. Garnish shrikhand with chopped nuts.
