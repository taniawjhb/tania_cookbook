Creamed Spinach with Nutmeg
50g butter
1 onion, finely chopped
4 tbsp plain flour
400ml full-fat milk
800gms spinach
200ml single cream
fresh nutmeg, for grating
Heat the butter in a saucepan, then add the onion and cook for 5 mins until softened. Stir in the flour and cook for 3-4 mins, then slowly
start to whisk in the milk. When it has all been incorporated, gently cook for 5 mins until the sauce has thickened.
Meanwhile, place the spinach in a large pot. Place over medium high heat and close with the lid, if you need to add the spinach as it
collapses.  Once the spinach is well wilted, place the spinach in a clean dishcloth, squeeze out any excess liquid, then roughly chop.
Stir into the sauce with the cream, gently heat, then finely grate over some nutmeg and season well.
