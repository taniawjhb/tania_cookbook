The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.
Dauphinoise Potatoes
500ml double cream
500ml milk
3 garlic cloves
8 large King Edward or Maris Piper potatoes
100g Gruyère cheese (optional)
Tip the cream, milk and garlic into a large saucepan and bring to a simmer.
Slice the potatoes very finely, about 3-4mm, add them to the cream and simmer for 3 mins until just cooked.
Gently stir to separate the potato and stop it sinking and catching on the bottom of the pan.
Remove the potatoes with a slotted spoon and place in a wide shallow ovenproof dish so that they are about
5cm in depth. Pour over the garlic infused cream (discarding the garlic) – just enough to seep through the layers
and leave a little moisture on the surface.
Scatter over the cheese, if using, then bake for 30 mins until the potatoes are soft and browned – increase the
heat for 5 mins if not brown enough.
