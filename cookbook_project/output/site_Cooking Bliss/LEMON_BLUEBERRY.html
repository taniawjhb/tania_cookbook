LEMON BLUEBERRY 
CHEESECAKE BARS
Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line a 9x13 inch pan
with foil or parchment with plenty of overhang around the edges to
lift the bars out of the pan before cutting.
Prepare the crust by combining flour, sugar, salt, and butter
cubes in a food processor or blender. Cover and pulse until fine
crumbs form. (You can also do this with a pastry cutter, fork, or with
your fingers in a large bowl.)
Press crust into prepared pan and bake for 10 minutes
while you prepare the filling.
Prepare the filling by combining cream cheese and sugar
in a large bowl. Cream together until smooth. Mix in flour,
powdered sugar, lemon juice, eggs, and vanilla until completely
incorporated.  Now stir in the blueberries.
Pour filling over crust and return to oven for 30 minutes.
Allow to cool for about 20 minutes, then cover and transfer
chill in the fridge 4 hours or overnight. Lift the foil edges to remove
the bars from the pan, slice into squares, sprinkle with additional
powdered sugar, and serve.
