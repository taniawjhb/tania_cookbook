<h1>MUSHROOOM SOUP</h1>
<pre>
INGREDIENTS
30g / 2 tbsp unsalted butter
1 onion , chopped
2 garlic cloves , minced
400g white mushrooms
200g Portabellini Mushrooms
800 ml vegetable stock or chicken stock
1/4 tsp salt , cooking/kosher
pinch tsp black pepper
200 ml crème fraiche or cream 
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Chopping mushrooms: Cut mushrooms into 4 
slices, then dice into 3 or 4 pieces.
Step 2:  Melt butter in a large pot over medium high heat. 
Add onion and garlic. Cook for 3 minutes until softened, 
but not golden.
Step 3:   Add mushrooms and cook for 10 minutes, stirring 
regularly. Do not try to brown; they won't as the pot is too 
crowded but we do not need colour.
Step 4:  Add vegetable stock, salt and pepper. Bring to a 
boil, then lower heat to medium and simmer gently for 
15 minutes without a lid.
Step 5:  Stir in cream (or crème fraiche), then simmer for 
another 5 minutes
Step 6:  Transfer to a blender (do in batches, if necessary). 
Remove the cap from the feeding hole in the blender lid 
(Note 5), cover the hole with a folded tea towel. Blend 
until completely smooth.
Step 7:  Return to pot, simmer for a minute or two until 
bubbles caused by blending largely subside and soup is 
hot.
Step 8:  Serve: Ladle into bowls. Garnish with a drizzle of 
extra virgin olive oil or cream, croutons and parsley or (if 
you're feeling a bit fancy), chervil. Don't forget bread for 
dunking!
