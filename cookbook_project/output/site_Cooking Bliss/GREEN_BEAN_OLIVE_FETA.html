INGREDIENTS
Water
450gms green beans, trimmed
Salt and pepper, to taste
Crushed red pepper flakes, optional, to taste
100gms quality crumbled feta cheese, to 
taste
2 tbsp (or more to your liking) pitted olives, 
chopped
Handful of cherry tomatoes, cut in half
For dressing 
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
2 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced
2 tbsp chopped fresh dill
1/2 tsp sweet Spanish paprika

INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Prepare dressing. In a small bowl, whisk together 
extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, fresh dill, Spanish 
paprika, pinch of salt and pepper. Set aside for now.
Step 2:   Bring a large pot filled with water to a boil. Add green 
beans. Cook for 5 minutes, then, keep the pot of boiling water 
going, but using tongs, transfer green beans to an ice bath (a 
bowl of ice and ice cold water) for 5 minutes. Return beans to 
boiling water to finish cooking until tender, about 10 more 
minutes or so.  Drain well.
Step 3:   Transfer warm beans to a mixing bowl.   Add the 
chopped tomatoes, toss with a little salt and pepper. Give the 
dressing a quick stir to combine well, then pour over the green 
beans. Toss again to coat.
Step 4:   Transfer to a serving platter. Sprinkle crushed pepper 
flakes and crumbled feta. Top with chopped olives. Serve at 
room temperature.
