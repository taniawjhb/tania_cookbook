<h1>KARIDOPITA</h1>
<pre>
INGREDIENTS
For the cake
380g chopped walnut (13 ounces)
180g powdered Melba toast or 
breadcrumbs 
20g baking powder 
1 flat tsp powdered nutmeg
2 tsps powdered cinnamon
1/2 tsp grounded clove
200g butter
165g sugar
7 eggs (separated into whites and yolks)
zest of 1 orange
75ml brandy (1/3 of a cup)
For the syrup
2 cups sugar
100 grams honey (3.5 oz)
2 cups water
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tbsp orange juice
1/4 of a cup cognac
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Use an electric mixer to mix the sugar and butter; 
mix at medium-high speed for at least 5 minutes, until 
smooth and creamy. Add the egg yolks, one at a time, 
whilst continue mixing; wait each time for each egg to 
be absorbed, before adding the next. Pour in the brandy  
and the orange zest and mix for 10 more seconds. Set 
aside.
Step 2:   Into a large bowl, add the chopped walnut, the 
powdered Melba toast, the cinnamon, the clove, the 
nutmeg, the baking powder and blend with a spoon. 
(Chop the walnut, using a blender, but be careful not to 
powder it; the authentic greek walnut cake calls for 
roughly chopped walnuts.)
Step 3:   Combine the two mixtures and blend, until 
smooth.
Step 4:   Place the egg whites into the bowl of the electric 
mixer, along with a pinch of salt. Make sure your egg 
whites, bowl and whisk attachments are clean and free 
of any water. Whisk the egg whites until the mixture is 
very thick and glossy and a long trailing peak forms 
when the whisk is lifted (meringues).
Step 5:   With a spatula add gradually the meringues into 
the mixture and blend with light circular movements from 
the bottom up.
Step 6:   Butter the bottom and the sides of a round 
baking tray, approx 30cm diameter and bake in a 
preheated oven at 170C, for about 35 minutes, until 
nicely colored on the outside and baked through.
Step 7:  Let the karidopita (greek walnut cake) to cool and 
then prepare the syrup. Add all the ingredients for the 
syrup into a pot, and boil, until the sugar has dissolved. 
Scar the cake into pieces, and slowly ladle the hot syrup 
over the cold cake, allowing time for each ladle of syrup 
to be absorbed.
Step 8:   Let it cool down for a while, before serving. This 
Greek walnut cake is ideally served cold with some 
vanilla ice-cream aside. Enjoy!!
