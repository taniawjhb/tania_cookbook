<h1>GREEN GODDESS SALAD</h1>
<pre>
INGREDIENTS
2 hearts of romaine
4 green onions
1 stalk celery chopped
1 cup cherry tomatoes, diced
1/2 bunch dill
1/2 bunch mint
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
For the Green Goddess Dressing
1 cup whole milk Greek yogurt
1 cup fresh parsley
1 cup mixed soft leafy herbs, dill, mint, 
tarragon and/or cilantro
2 tablespoons chopped chives
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus ½
teaspoon zest
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons capers
1 small garlic clove
¼ teaspoon sea salt
Freshly ground black pepper
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Prepare a large mixing bowl with ice water. Thinly 
slice the romaine lettuce, then add to the ice water for 5 
minutes to crisp while you prepare the dressing and 
remaining ingredients.
Step 2:  Trim and finely chop the green onions (both the white 
and green parts). Finely chop the dill and mint leaves, 
discarding the stem.
Step 3:  Make the dressing. In a food processor, combine the 
yogurt, parsley, mixed herbs, chives, lemon juice, zest, olive oil, 
capers, garlic, salt, and pepper. Pulse until well combined. 
Season to taste.
Step 4:  Drain the salad from the ice water and dry very 
thoroughly. A salad spinner helps if you have one, or use 
paper towels. Add to a large serving bowl, along with the 
celery, chopped tomatoes, chopped herbs, and feta. Give 
everything a gentle toss.
Step 5:  Just before serving, give the dressing one more quick 
whisk and pour a third of it all over the salad. Mix well and 
coat it well with the dressing). If preferred add some more 
dressing.  Serve immediately.
