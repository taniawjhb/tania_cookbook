QUICK CREME BRULEE
500 ml cream
1 vanilla pod OR 1 tsp vanilla bean paste 
5 egg yolks
50 g caster sugar
Caramel Topping
40 g caster sugar
Step 1:  If you are using a vanilla bean infuse 
cream: Simmer uncovered over low heat for 10 
minutes. Remove from stove and set aside to 
infuse for 1 hour with lid on (you can skip this 
step if using paste or extract, just let it cool to 
lukewarm). Remove vanilla pod. Skim off any 
skin that has formed on the surface.
Preparation: Preheat oven to 130°C. Place 4 x 
empty ramekins in a baking pan with high 
enough sides that enough water can be 
poured in to come halfway up ramekins.
Boil water: Boil a kettle of water.
Whisk egg yolks and sugar: Whisk yolks and 
sugar until just well combined. Don't whisk too 
much, as this can create bubbles.
Add cream: Pour cream into eggs and gently 
stir to combine. Divide mixture between 
ramekins with a soup ladle.
Water bath: Pour in enough boiling water so it 
comes halfway up the sides of the ramekins. (If 
you have too much water, ramekins will float 
around – not good!)
Bake: Bake for 35 – 40 minutes, or until the 
custard is set but there is still a slight wobble 
when you GENTLY give the ramekin a little 
shake.
Chill: Remove ramekins from water. Leave to 
cool, then refrigerate for at least 6 hours and 
preferably overnight (up to 3 days is OK).
Blow torch method: Sprinkle 1/2 tsp sugar over 
the surface of each crème brûlée. Use a blow 
torch to melt and caramelise the sugar. Serve 
immediately.
