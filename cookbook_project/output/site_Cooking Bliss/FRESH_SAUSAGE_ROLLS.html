<h1>FRESH SAUSAGE ROLLS</h1>
<pre>
INGREDIENTS
1/2 tbsp olive oil
2 cloves garlic , minced
1 brown onion , small, finely chopped
1 celery stalk , finely chopped
150g bacon , finely minced (streaky and 
fatty, not the lean stuff!)
2 tsp fennel seeds , toasted (optional) 
500g pork mince (ground pork) (not lean)
3/4 cup / 40g panko breadcrumbs 
1 egg
1/2 tsp salt
Black pepper
Baking & Serving
2 1/2 sheets puff pastry , thawed then each 
cut into half 
1 egg , lightly whisked
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Heat oil in a non stick fry pan over medium high heat. 
Saut√© garlic, onion & celery for 2 minutes, then add bacon.
Step 2:   Cook for a further 2 minutes (don't make bacon 
golden) then transfer to bowl and allow to cool for 10 minutes.
Step 3:   Add remaining Filling ingredients into the bowl. Use 
your hands to mix well.
Step 4:  Lay out a rectangle of pastry, long edge closest to you. 
Brush egg along one long edge.
Step 5:  Get 1/5 th of the filling and shape into a long log 
shape down the middle of the pastry. Ensure the meat is tight 
and compact, without gaps.
Step 6:  Brush edge of pastry with egg. Then roll up, finishing 
with the seam side down.  Roll up, sealing on the edge with 
egg wash on it .
Step 7:  If you have time/patience, refrigerate for 1 hour 
(makes it easier/neater to cut)
To Cook
Step 1:  Preheat oven to 350F/180C.
Step 2:  Cut each log into equal lengths, just two if you want 
full size sausage rolls. Brush with egg.
Step 3:  Place on 2 baking trays lined with baking paper (or 
sprayed with oil). Bake for 30 - 35 minutes in total, swapping 
tray shelves at 20 minutes, or until the pastry is deep golden 
brown. (Note: The filling will still look pink because of the 
bacon, but it's easy to tell from texture that it's cooked)
Step 4:  Cool slightly on trays. Serve hot or warm with tomato 
sauce or ketchup!
