Spaghetti alla Puttanesca
Spaghetti in the style of “whores”
450g dried spaghetti
1/2 cup (120ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided
4 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced or finely chopped by hand (see note above)
4 to 6 anchovy fillets, finely chopped (20–30ml chopped anchovy)
Large pinch red pepper flakes
1/4 cup capers, drained and chopped (60g)
1/4 cup chopped pitted black olives (60g)
1 (14-ounce; about 400g) can whole peeled tomatoes, preferably San Marzano, roughly broken up by hand
Small handful minced fresh parsley leaves
1 ounce (30g) finely grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
Freshly ground black pepper
1. In a medium skillet, combine 6 tablespoons oil, garlic, anchovies, and red pepper flakes. Cook over medium
heat until garlic is very lightly golden, about 5 minutes. (Adjust heat as necessary to keep it gently sizzling.) Add
capers and olives and stir to combine.
2. Add chopped and deseeded tomatoes, stir to combine, and bring to a bare simmer. Continue to simmer until
tomatoes have started to break down and flavours have balanced nicely.
3, Now cook your spaghetti to just under al dente (about 1 minute less than the package recommends).
4. Using tongs, transfer pasta to sauce. Alternatively, drain pasta through a colander, reserving 1 cup of the
cooking water. Add drained pasta to sauce.
5. Add a few tablespoons of pasta water to sauce and increase heat to bring pasta and sauce to a vigorous
simmer. Cook, stirring and shaking the pan and adding more pasta water as necessary to keep sauce loose,
until pasta is perfectly al dente, 1 to 2 minutes longer. (The pasta will cook more slowly in the sauce than it did in
the water.) Stir in remaining olive oil, parsley, and cheese.
6. Season with salt and pepper. (Be generous with the pepper and scant with the salt—the dish will be plenty
salty from the other ingredients.) If using, stir in canned tuna and break it up with a fork. Serve immediately with
more grated cheese at the table.
