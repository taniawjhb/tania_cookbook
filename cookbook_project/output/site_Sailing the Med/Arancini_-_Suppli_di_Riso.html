Arancini - Suppli’ di Riso
Little Oranges - small crisp deep fried rice balls
1 cup long-grain rice
1 small onion
1 stick celery finely chopped
1 small carrot finely chopped
4 tbs. butter
3 cups chicken broth
5 tbs. grated Parmigiano
80 gms finely diced Mozzarella
40 gms finely diced anchovy fillets
30gms parsley, chopped
4 eggs
breadcrumbs
nutmeg
olive oil
salt
pepper
Flour
In a heavy based pot saute the onion, carrot and celery in the butter until soft and translucent. Then add the rice
and fry it until it is sizzling. Then add the hot broth slowly, stirring frequently. The rice should be done in about 20
min. When the rice is ready, mix in half the parmesan, and then spread the rice out in a flat baking tray to cool.
Mix the chopped mozzarella and anchovy, the rest of the parmesan, the chopped parsley, 1 egg, nutmeg, salt
and pepper (If the mixture is a little wet add some more parmesan). With slightly damp hands, take a handful of
rice in one hand, and a pinch of stuffing with the other. Push the stuffing into the middle of the rice. Squeeze the
rice all around the stuffing and mould it into an egg shape.
When you have used up all the mix, flour the croquettes, dip into beaten eggs, and then roll again in
breadcrumbs. Fry the suppli' in very hot oil, once golden and cooked through place on paper towel to darin and
serve immediately.
