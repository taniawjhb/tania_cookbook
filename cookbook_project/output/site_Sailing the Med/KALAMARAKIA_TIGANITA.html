<h1>KALAMARAKIA TIGANITA</h1>
<pre>
700g calamari (25 oz.)
100g bread flour (3.5 oz.)
50g semolina flour (1.5 oz.)
1 tbsp peppercorns (or ground pepper)
2 tbsps salt
1/2 tbsp paprika (optional)
1 tbsp oregano (optional)
vegetable oil for frying
To start clean the calamari and wash thoroughly. Using a sharp
knife cut the calamari in slices, approx. 1 cm each. This will
create the rings. Place the calamari rings on some paper towel
to get ride of the excessive water.
Prepare the seasoning for the fried calamari. In a blender add
the seasoning and pulse until powdered. (Alternatively you can
use a pestle.)
In a large sandwich bag or tupperware add the flour and
seasoning. Place in the sliced calamari and shake well to coat
(you will need to do this in batches). Remove the calamari onto a
plate, shaking of any excess flour.
Into a medium sized frying pan pour enough vegetable oil to
deep fry the calamari. Heat the oil to medium high heat until it
begins to bubble. Test if the oil is hot enough by dipping one of
the calamari rings in; if it sizzles the oil is ready. Fry the calamari
in batches for about 2-3 minutes, until nicely golden.
Remove the fried calamari using a slotted spoon and place on
some paper towel to dry for 1-2 minutes. Have a taste and
sprinkle with some more salt.
Serve hot with some lemon wedges.
