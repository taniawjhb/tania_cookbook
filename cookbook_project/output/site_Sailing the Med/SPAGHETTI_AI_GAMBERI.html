INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1: To prepare Spaghetti with Prawns, start by cleaning the 
prawns, taking care to keep the heads aside and eliminate 
the internal black vein.
Step 2:  Wash, clean and cut the cherry tomatoes in half. Peel 
the garlic clove, clean the shallot and slice it quite finely.
Step 3:  Pour a tbsp or two of olive oil into a large pan, add 
the prawn heads, one of the two cloves of garlic, the sliced  
shallot, a couple of cherry tomatoes and cook for a few 
minutes.  Until the prawns and garlic are fragrant and starting 
to colour.
Step 4:  Add the wine and water and continue cooking for 
another fifteen minutes, taking care to crush the prawn heads 
with a wooden spoon to flavor the stock.
Step 5:  In the meantime, take a non-stick pan, pour in the 
remaining oil, add the garlic clove, the leftover cherry tomatoes 
and saut√© everything over a high heat for a few minutes.
Step 6:  While this is happening cook the spaghetti in plenty of 
lightly salted water, remembering to drain it when it is still al 
dente.
Step 7:  Add the cleaned prawns to the pan with the 
tomatoes, continuing cooking for another couple of minutes.
Step 8:  Take the pan with the prawn heads again, remove 
them, process the rest of the ingredients with a food mill and 
then pass the liquid obtained through a narrow mesh strainer.
Step 9:  Add the liquid just obtained into the pan with the 
cherry tomatoes and prawns, stir to combine and also add 
the spaghetti.
Step 10:  Stir to combine the spaghetti with the sauce and 
finish cooking the pasta. Plate, sprinkle with fresh chopped 
parsley and serve.
