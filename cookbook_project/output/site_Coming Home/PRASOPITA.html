For the leek pie
12–15 phyllo sheets, thawed
800–900 g leeks, sliced 
3–4 spring onions, finely chopped
1/2 a glass white wine
1 egg yolk
250ml milk or milk cream
150g feta cheese, crumbled
100g Graviera cheese, or hard yellow 
cheese 
salt and freshly ground pepper
olive oil or butter for brushing the pan
1 egg and 1 tsp water to brush the top
Instructions
Step 1:  It is important to thaw your phyllo completely by 
putting it in the fridge the previous day. 
Step 2:  Start by making the filling. Wash the leeks and trim 
them, keeping only the white part and cut in slices about 2cm 
wide
Step 3:  Heat a saucepan, add olive oil, the leeks and 
scallions and season with salt and pepper. Sauté, whilst 
stirring, until tender. Once the leeks are tender deglaze with 
the white wine and wait for it to evaporate. Remove the pan 
from the stove and allow the leeks to cool down.
Step 4:  In a bowl add 1 egg yolk and the milk cream and 
whisk. Stir in the leeks mixture, feta cheese, graviera cheese, 
season with pepper and blend to combine.
Step 5:  Brush a medium sized baking tray with olive oil and 
lay one sheet of phyllo dough, allowing it to exceed the pan. 
Brush the phyllo sheet with olive oil or melted butter and 
continue with 5-6 more phyllo sheets (brushing each one with 
olive oil or melted butter). Tip in the filling and even out using 
a spatula. With a knife trim some of the excessive phyllo, and 
fold the excess phyllo sheets flaps over the mixture. Add 5-6 
more phyllo sheets, making sure to oil or butter each one, 
before adding the other. Trim some of the excessive phyllo 
and roll the rest on the edges.
Step 6:  In a bowl whisk the egg and the water, brush the top 
of the leek pie and carefully score into pieces. Bake in 
preheated oven at 180C for about 50 minutes, until nicely 
coloured. Allow to cool slightly and serve.
