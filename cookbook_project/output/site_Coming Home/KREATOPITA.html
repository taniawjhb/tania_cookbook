thyme
Instructions
Step 1:  Preheat the oven to 200 Â°C.
Step 2:  Make the Meat Sauce: Ina. large pot over medium 
heat, add the onion with the olive oil and a pinch of salt. Cook 
the onons until soft and golden. Add the garlic and warm 
through. Add the ground meat, the seasonings (except for the 
thyme/oregano) and tomatoes. Mix together and cook over 
medium-high heat for about 25 minutes or until thickened. 
Remove from heat and add the oregano. Taste and adjust 
seasoning if needed. Add double the crushed tomatoes if you 
prefer a thicker sauce.
 Step 1:  In a large baking pan (half-sheet pan will work or a 
roasting pan) add the breadcrumbs in an even layer.
Step 2:  Divide the phyllo into 2 equal stacks. Layer the first 
stack in the pan and drizzle butter in between the phyllo 
layers (see video).
Step 3:  Crumble some feta cheese into the center of the 
phyllo . Add the meat sauce on top. Spread the diced roasted 
peppers over the meat sauce. Top with shredded cheese. Fold 
the phyllo that is hanging outside of the pan over the filling. 
Drizzle butter between those layers as well.
Step 4:  Gather each of the remeaining sheets of phyllo and 
create an accordion. Place them on top of the pie for a 
decorative, crunchy top layer. Brush and pour the remaining 
butter over the phyllo.
Step 5:  Bake on the center rack for about 45 minutes or until 
golden.  Allow the pie to rest for 25-30 minutes and serve. Kali
