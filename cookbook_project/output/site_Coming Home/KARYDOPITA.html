For the syrup
500 ml water
300 g sugar
5 ml freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 slice lemon
1 cinnamon stick
For the cake:
350 g coarsely crushed walnuts
6 large eggs
1/2 tsp ground cloves optional
5 ml ground cinnamon
10 ml baking powder
300 ml milk
400 g granulated white sugar
250 ml vegetable oil
375 g all-purpose flour
Instructions
Step 1:  Prepare your syrup by combining all of the ingredients 
in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil and when the sugar has 
dissolved, reduce heat to medium.  Allow to cook for 
approximately 5 minutes and then remove syrup from heat.  
Allow to cool.  Note: this produces a cake that is not overly 
syrupy, however, if you do prefer a syrupy cake, please feel 
free to increase the quantities for the syrup above.

slice lemon,1 cinnamon stick)
Step 2:  Preheat your oven to 180C.
Step 3:  In a large bowl combine all of the cake ingredients.  
The order is not particularly important.  Stir until very well 
combined with a rubber spatula or large plastic or wooden 
spoon.  Mix very well until the entire batter is uniform.
Step 4:  Grease your baking pan (we used a 25cm round cake 
pan) with vegetable oil, being sure to cover the bottom and 
sides.
Step 5:  Pour in your batter.  Spread it around so that it is 
evenly distributed.  Bake in center of oven for approximately 
50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of 
the cake comes out clean.
Step 6:  When your cake is done, remove it from the oven and 
gently poke holes in it, using a skewer or a sharp knife. Pour 
the cooled syrup all over the cake, about 1/2 cup (125 ml) at a 
time.  The syrup will be absorbed by the cake.
Step 7:  Allow your cake to cool and serve it directly from your 
baking pan.
