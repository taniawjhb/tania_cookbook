<h1>HTIPITI</h1>
<pre>
For the leek pie
2 red peppers, cleaned and sliced in 
half white membranes removed
200 g feta cheese
Â¼ cup olive oil, extra virgin
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon chilli flakes, dried
1 pinch salt
1 pinch pepper
Instructions
Step 1:  Preheat your oven to 200 deg C / 180 deg C fan-
forced. Clean your peppers and slice them in half. Place on a 
lined baking tray and roast for 20 minutes until the skin 
blisters and is dark.
Step 2:  Place the roasted red peppers in a small bowl and 
cover with a plate. Make sure the plate provides a seal. We 
want to sweat the peppers and make it easier to peel the 
blistered skin.
Step 3:  Remove the plate after ten minutes and clean the 
peppers by peeling the charred bits.
Step 4:  Place the roasted red peppers, feta cheese, olive oil, 
chilli and seasonings in the food processor. Blend until the 
mixture comes together and forms a paste.
Step 5:  Serve immediately or refrigerate for a few hours and 
serve later.
