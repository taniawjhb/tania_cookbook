BURFI ICE CREAM
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1 cup milk
150g white sugar
5 egg yolks
1-2 tsp ground cardamom 
powder
1 tsp rose essence
1/4 cup flaked almonds, toasted lightly
Large pinch of saffron (Optional)
Combine heavy cream, milk, sugar, and cardamom powder in a 
saucepan; bring to a simmer over low heat. Cook and stir until 
sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, if adding 
saffron add now. Cover saucepan and allow the mixture to 
steep for 10 minutes.
Uncover pan and bring back to a simmer over low heat. Beat the 
egg yolks in a bowl. Gradually stir one cup of the hot cream 
mixture into the eggs, several tablespoons at a time. This will 
help to bring the eggs up to temperature without scrambling 
them.
Stir the egg mixture back into the cream mixture in the 
saucepan. Cook and stir over low heat until the mixture just 
coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a large 
bowl; cover. Refrigerate overnight.
Stir rose essence into the cold ice cream mixture, 
taste and adjust the rose based on your preferences. Freeze 
in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's directions.
Transfer ice cream to a lidded freezer container, 
sprinkle with the lightly toasted almonds and freeze for 4 
hours before serving.
