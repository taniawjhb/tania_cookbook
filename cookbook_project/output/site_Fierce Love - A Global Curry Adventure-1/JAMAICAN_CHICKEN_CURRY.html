<h1>JAMAICAN CHICKEN CURRY</h1>
<pre>
2 tablespoons (2 tablespoons) Oil
1 tablespoon (1 tablespoon) Minced Ginger
1 tablespoon (1 tablespoon) Minced Garlic
1 cup (160 g) onions, chopped
1.5 tablespoons (1.5 tablespoons) Jamaican
Curry Powder
1 Scotch Bonnet Pepper, sliced
3 sprigs Fresh Thyme, or 1/2 teaspoon Dried
Thyme
1 teaspoon (1 teaspoon) Kosher Salt
1/2 teaspoon (0.5 teaspoon) Ground Allspice
500gms Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs, cut
into 3 pieces each
1 Potatoes, large, cut into 1-inch chunks
1 cup (250 ml) Water
Heat a large pot or saute pan over medium heat, once hot add the
oil.
When the oil is hot, add ginger and garlic, and stir for 20 seconds.
Add chopped onion and mix well, cook until the onions have
softened up (about 1-2 minutes).
Add the Jamaican curry powder, the sliced scotch bonnet pepper,
thyme, salt and allspice and mix well.
At this point, if you have any browning or sticking that has occurred,
use 1/4-1/3 cup of water to deglaze, scraping well, and allowing
the water to evaporate.
Add chicken, potato, and 1-2 cups of water, stir well and then
simmer on medium heat for about 20-30 minutes covered,
checking and adding liquid as required.
Once the potatoes are cooked and the chicken is tender remove
from the heat. Check and adjust seasoning.
