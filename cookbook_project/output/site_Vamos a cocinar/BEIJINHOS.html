BEIJINHOS
Ingredients
1 can of sweet condesned milk 
1 cup of unsweetened, shredded coconut
1 tablespoon of butter plus a little more for 
your hands
1/4 cup of heavy cream
16 whole cloves for decorating optional
Method
1. Add the condensed milk, the butter, and the cream to a 
medium sauce pan and place it over medium heat until the 
butter melts.
2.  After the butter has melted, add half of the shredded 
coconut (1/2 cup) to the pan and stir.
3.  Continue to cook over medium heat, for approximately 10 
mins, stirring repeatedly, scraping the sides and the bottom 
of the pan with a spatula to avoid burning.
4.  The beijinho is ready when you scrape the bottom of the 
pan, and the mixture takes 2-3 seconds to come back to its 
place, or when the mixture reaches 99-104C – You can use 
a candy thermometer, or just a regular food thermometer to 
check.
5.  Pour the hot coconut mixture into a dish, or plate, cover 
with plastic wrap to contact and let it cool – about 2 hours.
6.  Meanwhile, pour the remaining shredded coconut in a 
deep plate or bowl.
9.  When the beijinho mixture has cooled, butter your hands, 
and scoop 1/2 Tbsp to Tbsp portions and roll little balls.
10.  Roll the little balls in the shredded coconut, and insert a 
whole clove to each little coconut ball to decorate, if desired.
11.  Keep them in a cool place or in the refrigerator until 
serving time.
