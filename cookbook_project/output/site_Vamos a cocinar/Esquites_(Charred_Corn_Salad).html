Esquites (Charred Corn Salad)
4 cups corn (about 5 ears)
1 tbsp olive oil
1/2 red bell pepper chopped
1/2 small red onion finely chopped
1/2 cup fresh cilantro chopped
6 spring onions chopped
1 jalapeno pepper diced
1/2 avocado chopped
4 tbsp lime juice (from about 2 limes)
1/2 tsp cumin ground
1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1/4 tsp black pepper ground
1/4 tsp salt
2 tbsp sour cream (or yogurt)
2 tbsp mayonnaise
1/2 cup feta, crumbled
Start by charring the corn over a hot braai or in a very hot griddle pan. Allow to cool until it can be handled, then
cut the corn off the cob and set aside in a large bowl.
(You can also use canned corn or frozen corn. If using frozen, no need to thaw it out. You will need to char it in a
very hot dry pan)
Transfer the corn to a large bowl and let it cool for a couple minutes.
To the same bowl, add the remaining ingredients. Stir everything together (excluding the diced avocado) until well
combined. Now add the avocado, mix gently, taste and then adjust lime juice and salt and pepper as necessary.
To serve garnish with additional cheese and cilantro, if preferred.
