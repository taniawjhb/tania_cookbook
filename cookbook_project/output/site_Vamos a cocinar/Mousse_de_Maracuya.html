Mousse de Maracuya
400ml passion fruit pulp (100% pulp)
1 small can cream
1 can condensed milk
450ml heavy whipping cream
Remove the fruit required to make up 400ml pulp and add it to the jug of blender.
Whip heavy cream. I use an electric hand held mixer. Whip until peaks of the cream stay firm and donâ€™t lose their shape. Set
it aside. Do not overwhip the cream.
Blend the passion fruit pulp, cream and condensed milk.
Pour the blended mix into the bowl where you whipped the cream. Make sure you have a big enough mixing bowl.
Fold the blended mix into the whipped cream. Pour onto serving cups. You can add crumbled cookies in the bottom if
desired. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
Serve with fresh passion fruit, raspberries, whipped cream and optional other toppings according to taste.
