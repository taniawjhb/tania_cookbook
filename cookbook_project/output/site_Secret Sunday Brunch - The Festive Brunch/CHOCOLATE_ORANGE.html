INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Preheat the oven to 190C. Line a muffin tin with paper 
cases (remember, muffin cases are bigger than cupcake 
cases, so if you're using a cupcake tray, this mix will probably 
make more than 12 and will need a little less cooking time).
Step 2:   Pop the zest & juice from the oranges in a jug, then 
top up with enough milk reach 250ml.
Step 3: Add in the beaten egg and oil and stir well.
Step 4:   In a large mixing bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, 
salt, bicarb, cinnamon and cocoa powder together. Add the 
sugar and mix to combine.
Step 5:   Pour the jug of wet ingredients into the bowl of dry, 
and quickly and smoothly fold them together.
Step 6:   Spoon into the awaiting cases and bake for 20 - 25 
minutes until the tops spring back when pressed, and a 
skewer comes out clean.
Step 7:   Let cool fully before storing or freezing.
