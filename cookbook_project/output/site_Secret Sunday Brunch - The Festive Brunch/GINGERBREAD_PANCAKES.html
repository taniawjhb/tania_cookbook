<h1>GINGERBREAD PANCAKES</h1>
<pre>
INGREDIENTS
2 cups all-purpose flour (240g)
2 teaspoons baking powder
¼ teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground ginger
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
½ teaspoon ground cloves
1¼ cup whole milk (300ml)
2 large eggs
⅓ cup unsulphured molasses (80ml)
4 tablespoons unsalted butter melted (56g)
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, 
baking powder, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, and 
cloves.
Step 2:  In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, 
molasses, and melted butter until well combined. Pour the wet 
ingredients into the dry ingredients, and whisk together until 
just combined. (A few lumps are okay.)
Step 3:  Preheat a griddle or nonstick skillet over medium heat. 
Lightly grease with butter.
Step 4:  Working in batches, drop the batter by about ¼ to ⅓
cup for each pancake onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles 
form on top and the bottom is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. 
Flip the pancakes and cook until golden on the other side, 
about 2 minutes. Continue, buttering the pan between 
batches. Serve the warm pancakes with butter and maple 
syrup, if desired.
