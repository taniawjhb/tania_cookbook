Meatballs in tomato sauce
Best eaten hot and fresh right out the pan with crusty bread
2 tablespoons of olive oil 
750gms ground beef
11/4 cup fresh white breadcrumbs
8 tablespoons grated Manchego or Parmesan cheese 
3 tablespoon tomato paste
4 cloves garlic, chopped fine
1 1/2 red onions, chopped fine
3 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme 
11/4 teaspoon turmeric
Salt and pepper, to taste
500ml canned plum tomatoes, chopped 
4 tablespoons red wine
4 teaspoons chopped fresh basil leaves 
3 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary
In a bowl, thoroughly mix together the beef, breadcrumbs, cheese, tomato paste, garlic, scallions, egg, 
thyme, turmeric, salt, and pepper. Using your hands, shape the mixture into 24 to 30 firm balls.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs and cook for several minutes or until 
browned on all sides.  Remove the meatballs and set aside.
Add the tomatoes, wine, basil, and rosemary. Simmer gently for around 15 minutes, then add back the 
meatballs and cook until the meatballs are done. Season generously with salt and pepper and serve hot 
with crusty bread and good olive oil.
