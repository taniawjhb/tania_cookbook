<h1>CRUNCHY TANGY ROAST</h1>
<pre>
INGREDIENTS
900g starchy potatoes
2 tbsp tomato paste
1 tbsp smoked paprika
2-3 tbsp fresh diced parsley
2 tsp dried thyme
1/2 tsp salt, plus a bit extra for salting your 
water
1/2 tsp pepper
2 1/2 tbsp olive oil
1/2 fresh lemon
extra parsley for garnish
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Preheat your oven to 200 C,  and line a baking sheet 
with aluminum foil. Set aside.
Step 2:  Bring a pot of salted water to a boil while you dice 
your potatoes. Cook the potatoes 8-10 minutes until just al 
dente, you don't need to cook them through, but a fork should 
be able to pierce a cube. 
Step 3:  While the potatoes are cooking, combine your spices, 
tomato paste, and olive oil in a large mixing bowl. Drain the 
potatoes and then add them to the mixing bowl and mix until 
well coated.
Step 4:  Place the seasoned potatoes on your baking sheet 
and bake 40-50 minutes, turning halfway, until cooked 
through and crispy.
Step 5:  Top with juice from half a lemon and fresh parsley just 
before serving. Serve immediately and enjoy!
