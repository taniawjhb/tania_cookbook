The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 onion diced
2 garlic cloves finely chopped
1 teaspoon sweet smoked paprika pimenton 
dulce - or hot paprika if you like it spicy
2 bay leaves
2 cans butter beans, drained and rinsed
2 cans plum tomatoes
Sea salt and black pepper
2 large handfuls spinach roughly chopped
In a large saucepan, heat the oil over a medium heat. Add the 
onions and fry, stirring continuously, for 3-5 minutes until translucent 
but not browned.
Add the garlic, paprika and bay leaves and fry for a further minute.
Add the beans and tomatoes. Stir and break up the tomatoes a bit, 
then season with salt and pepper. Stir well and reduce the heat to 
low. Simmer for 15 minutes, checking regularly so it doesnâ€™t stick to 
the bottom of the pan.
As it finishes, stir the spinach through to wilt.
Serve hot or cold, as tapas or a side dish, sprinkled with the fresh 
parsley.
