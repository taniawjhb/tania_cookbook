Pollo al Ajillo
Garlicky chunks of fried chicken served with crusty bread
12 large chicken thighs, cut in half 
Fine sea or kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1/3 cup olive oil
12 cloves garlic, peeled and lightly crushed 
2 bay leaves
2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves 
200ml white wine
200ml chicken stock
Start by rinsing and patting dry your chicken pieces.  Now in a heavy based pan add the oil and the garlic cloves.  Now 
slowly bring the oil up to heat and allow the garlic pieces to start to brown.  As soon as they are lightly browned remove the 
garlic and set aside to use later.
Increase the heat to high, and add your chicken pieces and bay leaves (add the chicken pieces in batches do not overcrowd 
the pan), and fry the chicken over a medium high heat until it is cooked through and golden.
Remove chicken and set aside.  Now drain most of the oil away.  Add the cooked garlic, white wine and stock and allow it 
to come to the boil, once it has reduced slightly, add back the chicken pieces and cook for a few minutes until cooked 
through and sauce slightly thickened.
