<h1>Spanish Saffron Mussels</h1>
<pre>
Spanish Saffron Mussels
1/2 cup dry sherry a pinch of saffron
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1 tablespoon olive oil (I like Spanish olive oil)
1 teaspoon garlic (minced)
1 shallot (finely chopped)
2 ounces Spanish chorizo 1/4" dice* 4 cups seafood broth/stock*
1 teaspoon smoked paprika (hot or mild)
1 bay leaf
2 1/2 to 3 pounds fresh mussels (see notes) parsley to garnish
Warm the sherry (30 seconds in the microwave works), and add the pinch of saffron.
To a deep pot with a lid over medium-high heat, add a drizzle of olive oil, the garlic, shallot, and crushed red pepper.
When the shallot and garlic are fragrant (not browned), add the diced chorizo. Saute until the chorizo begins to give up some color, and 
shallot is transparent - about 5 minutes total.
Add the broth/stock, saffron infused sherry, smoked paprika, and bay leaf. Lower heat and simmer while you prepare the baguette.
Just prior to serving, add the mussels to the pot, cover, and cook 2 to 3 minutes (until the mussels are open). Ladle the broth over the 
mussels to let the shells catch a bit of the goodness, then ladle into shallow bowls.
Garnish with chopped parsley and toasted baguette.
