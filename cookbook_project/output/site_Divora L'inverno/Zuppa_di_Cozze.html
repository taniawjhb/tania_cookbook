Zuppa di Cozze
3 tbs. olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
2 stalks of celery, chopped 3-
4 cloves of garlic, minced Salt 
& Pepper to taste
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 cup Water
1 (14 oz.) Can Chopped Tomatoes
1,5 kg mussels, scrubbed with beards removed 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
Heat the oil in a large saucepan and saute the onion, celery and garlic until translucent. Add the 
tomatoes, salt and pepper and cook 5-10 minutes or until the sauce begins to thicken.
Add the wine and cook an additional 10 minutes, adding as much water as needed if the sauce becomes too 
thick.
Add the cleaned, drained mussels, cover, and cook until the shells open, which should be about 5 additional 
minutes.
Add the parsley just before serving.
You can serve this dish on grilled garlic bread, spooning the juices over the bread in a shallow bowl, or serve 
with a good crusty bread on the side.
