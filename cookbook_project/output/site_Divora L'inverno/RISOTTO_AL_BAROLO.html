30 g of Extra Virgin Olive Oil
45 g of butter
2 bay Leaves

INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1: To prepare the Risotto al Barolo, start by making the 
meat broth: then finely dice your onion. Add the  onion to a 
high-sided pan with a knob of butter, brown with the extra 
virgin olive oil and cook everything for about six minutes since 
the spring onion should be practically melted.
Step 2:  Now add your rice and toast the rice for a couple of 
minutes on a high flame, pour in the Barolo and let it 
evaporate completely. Then add a ladle of broth, a washed 
bay leaf and continue cooking the risotto, pouring more broth 
only when the previous liquid has been mostly absorbed.
Step 3:  Once cooked, it will take about 15 minutes, remove 
the bay leaf and, if you think it is necessary, adjust the salt. 
Then add the butter and parmesan for the creaming and mix 
the ingredients well together: finally plate the Risotto al Barolo 
and serve.
