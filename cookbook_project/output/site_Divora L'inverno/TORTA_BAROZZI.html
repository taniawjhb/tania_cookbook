Step 1: To Toast the almonds and peanuts. Place them in a 
preheated oven at 200°Cfor 5 minutes. Once toasted, remove 
from the oven and allow to cool.  Drop ther oven temperature 
to 170C
Step 2:   Place the toasted almonds and peanuts in a food 
processor and pulse until you have a medium to fine flour. Set 
aside.
Step 3:   In a double boiler, melt the chopped dark chocolate 
and butter at room temperature. Stir occasionally with a 
spatula. You want a smooth, even cream of chocolate and 
butter. Set aside.
Step 4:   Using an electric whisk, beat the sugar with the egg 
yolks until creamy and fluffy.
Step 5:   Add the ground almonds and peanuts, cocoa 
powder and coffee grounds.
Step 6:   Mix well with a spatula. Add the melted chocolate 
and butter. Mix everything with a spatula until the mixture is 
thick and smooth.
Step 7:   Beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff.
Step 8:   Add the beaten egg whites to the chocolate mixture. 
Add a little at a time, stirring in gentle circular motions from 
bottom to top so as not to break up the egg whites.
Step 9:   Line the baking pan with parchment paper. Pour the 
Barozzi cake mixture into the pan.
Step 10:   Bake in oven preheated to 170°C for about 30 
minutes. Check that the cake is done by inserting a toothpick 
in the center. It should come out clean and dry.

and serve dusted with icing sugar or cocoa powder.
