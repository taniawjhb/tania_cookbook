<pre>
270 g granulated sugar 4 
eggs
2 egg yolks
400 g milk
400 g heavy cream
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon(s) vanilla extract
1 teaspoon(s) baking powder 
450 g phyllo dough sheet 150 
g butter
1 tablespoon(s) dark brown soft sugar
2 tablespoon(s) icing sugar
1 tablespoon(s) cinnamon
Preheat the oven to 200*C (390*F) set to fan.
Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, and using a 
pastry brush, brush a 30x35 cm baking pan generously with butter.
Brush a sheet of phyllo dough with butter and place it in the pan. 
Brush another sheet with butter and place it on top.
Do not brush the rest of the phyllo sheets with butter; instead drizzle 
some butter on to them, one at a time. Crumple each sheet, folding it 
like an accordion and transfer to the pan.
Be careful not to press down on them so they don’t flatten.
Continue in the same way, placing each folded sheet of phyllo gently 
next to the other, until all of the sheets of phyllo dough are in the 
pan.
Drizzle the leftover butter over the top of the folded phyllo in the pan.
Bake for 20 minutes or until the phyllo turns golden brown and 
crunchy. To make sure it does become as crunchy as possible, place 
the baking pan on the highest rack in the oven so the air is able to 
reach both the top and bottom of the pan.
While the phyllo is baking, prepare the custard. Start by beating the 4 
eggs, 2 egg yolks, and sugar in a bowl, using a hand whisk. Beat 
until the sugar has completely dissolved.
Add the vanilla, baking powder, milk, heavy cream, salt similar to a 
crème anglaise.
When the sheets of phyllo dough are ready, remove from the oven. 
Turn the heat down to 180C.
Pour the custard mixture over the phyllo. Allow the pastry to abosorb 
the custard for a few minutes.
Sprinkle soft brown sugar over the top. This will give the surface a 
sweet crunch.
Return to the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes more.
When ready, remove from the oven and set aside to cool for a bit. 
Sprinkle with icing sugar and cinnamon. Cut into pieces and serve.
