<h1>TIROPITA</h1>
<pre>
8-10 sheets of phyllo pastry
340g feta cheese, crumbled
100g mild goats cheese,
120g Parmesan, or regato or Kefalograviera
2 egg, beaten
a splash of milk
fresh mint or dill, chopped (optional)
olive oil or melted butter
freshly ground pepper
To prepare the tiropita, start by preparing the filling. Crush the
feta cheese into a large bowl and add the grated cheese, the
egg, a splash of milk, and season with freshly ground pepper.
Mix well with a spoon to combine the ingredients. (At this point
you can add some chopped fresh herbs if you like; some fresh
dill or mint will surely lift the flavour).
Preheat the oven at 180C and start preparing the tiropita.
Spread one sheet of the phyllo dough on the kitchen counter
and with a cooking brush drizzle with some melted butter or
olive oil. Spread one more sheet on top and drizzle with some
more butter.
Cut the sheets into three or four lanes (depending on if you like
the tiropita to be small or larger). At the end of each lane add
one tablespoon of the filling. Fold one corner to form a triangle
and continue folding the triangle upon itself, until the entire piece
of phyllo is used. Continue with the rest phyllo sheets and filling.
Oil the bottom of a large baking tray, place the tiropita and brush
them with some melted butter on top. Bake in preheated oven at
180C for 25-30 minutes, until golden and crispy.
Cut each phyllo sheet into six, 5 cm strips along the long side.
Brush generously with the melted butter. Add one tablespoon of
the filling to one side of the long strip and begin to fold into a
triangle as the diagram below suggests. Continue until you have
used up all of the filling.
