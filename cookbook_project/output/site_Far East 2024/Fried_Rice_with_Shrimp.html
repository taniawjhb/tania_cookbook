Fried Rice with Shrimp
1.5 cups of cooked Jasmine rice cooled (or day old rice works well too) - Or just estimate about 1 normal bowl full
About 5 - 10 prawns, head peeled, but tail on
¼ of a big white onion (or ½ of a very small white onion))
1 cup fresh pineapple cut into 1cm cubes
½ head brocolli, broken into small florets
2 cloves garlic
2 eggs
½ tablespoon soy sauce
½ tablespoon oyster sauce
Pinch of sugar (optional)
1 tablespoon of oil for frying
5 Thai chilies
3 tablespoons of fish sauce
½ of a lime
If you’re using whole fresh shrimp, first pinch off the head, and peel the outer shell of the shrimp, leaving only the tail on (that’s Thai style).
Peel 2 cloves of garlic, and then just finely mince them, Slice ¼ of a sweet white onion into medium sized strips, finely dice about 3 - 4
green onions
Take your broccoli head, remove all thick stems, reserving small trimmed heads. Prepare your pineapple.
Turn on your stove to medium high, heat up your wok (or frying pan), and add about 1 tablespoon of oil
Once your oil is hot, add the garlic first, and stir fry continuously for about 15 seconds or so, until it gets nice and fragrant
Next, toss in your shrimp, and fry for about 30 seconds - your shrimp should start to turn pink and feel more firm. Now add the pineapple
Add in a little less than ½ of your rice first. This is going to soak up all those delicious shrimp juices and oils and keep your rice nice and
dry. Stir fry for about 10 more seconds - This is a little known trick to make good rice, so it remains nice and dry
Scoot all your rice to one side of the pan, and then crack in the eggs into the empty side. Whirl the egg up, let it cook for a few seconds,
and then start to mix it up with the rice and shrimp
Keep stir frying for about 20 seconds until the egg is fully cooked, and then add in the rest of your rice, and give it a quick stir
Add ½ tablespoon of soy sauce, ½ tablespoon of oyster sauce, just a pinch of sugar (optional), and continue stir frying your rice, making
sure all the sauce get mixed in
Then add your chopped Chinese broccoli and onions, and stir fry for another 30 seconds until the vegetables wilt, but they can still be
crisp and not fully cooked
Lastly, toss in your green onions, stir it a few more seconds, and it’s ready
Immediately dish your fried rice onto a plate
Slice off a wedge of lime, and serve it on the plate next to the rice
For the final touch, I like to sprinkle some freshly ground black pepper on top to give some extra flavor
