Dakgangjeong
1 pound boneless skinless chicken thigh and/or breast
1/2 cup milk optional
1/4 teaspoon salt
pinch pepper
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon minced ginger
1 tablespoon rice wine if not using milk
1/3 cup potato starch or corn starch
oil for deep frying
1 tablespoon soy sauce
3 tablespoons rice wine or mirin
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar or rice wine vinegar
1 tablespoon gochujang Korean red chili pepper paste
3 tablespoons honey or corn or rice syrup
2 teaspoons sesame oil
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon grated ginger
pinch pepper
1 to 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped peanuts or seeds
Soak the chicken pieces in milk for at least 2 hours in the fridge. This step is optional.
Drain thoroughly. Remove any visible fat. Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces. Mix with the salt, pepper, rice wine (if you
didn’t use milk) garlic, and ginger. Let it stand for 20 to 30 minutes.
In a pan, add all the sauce ingredients, and stir well. Bring it to a boil. When it starts to bubble, reduce the heat to medium
low, and simmer until it thickens slightly, about 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the heat off.
Add the potato (or corn) starch to the chicken, and mix well to coat evenly.
Pour about 1 inch of oil in to a heavy bottom pan. When the oil is sufficiently hot (180°C or starts smoking), drop the chicken
pieces in one at a time. Fry them in two batches. Overcrowding will drop the oil temperature too quickly. Cook until light
golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove and set them on a wire rack or a paper towel-lined plate.
Reheat the oil to 180°C. Deep fry again until golden brown, about 30 to 40 seconds. You can do the second frying in one
batch.
Heat the sauce over medium low heat. Add the chicken and stir well until the chicken pieces are evenly coated.
