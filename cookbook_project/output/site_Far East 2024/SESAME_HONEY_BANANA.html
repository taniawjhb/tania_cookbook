<h1>SESAME HONEY BANANA</h1>

SESAME HONEY BANANA
FRITTERS
4 to 5 big ripe bananas , cut into 1-inch
chunks
Oil for deep frying
Honey & lightly toasted sesame seeds to
serve with
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cornstarch
2 tablespoons milk (or plant-based milk for a
vegan dish)
1 tablespoon butter , melted
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1/2 cup water
Combine all the ingredients for the batter in a big bowl. Stir to
mix well. It should form a runny batter similar in consistency to a
pancake batter.
Heat 1 inch of oil in a small deep pot over medium-high heat
until hot. Test the oil by inserting a wooden chopstick. If the oil
sizzles and you can see small bubbles rising rapidly on the
chopstick, the oil is ready.
Line a large plate or baking sheet with a cooling rack. Add the
chopped bananas into the batter, a few pieces at a time, and
coat well. Gently transfer the bananas into the oil. Fry until all
sides turn golden brown. Transfer onto the cooling rack to drain
the extra oil. Fry all the bananas this way in batches.
Wait until the bananas cool down slightly. They will continue to
crisp.
Serve hot with honey and toasted sesame seeds
