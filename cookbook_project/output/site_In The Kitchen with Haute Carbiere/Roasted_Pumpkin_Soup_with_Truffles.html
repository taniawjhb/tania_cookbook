Roasted Pumpkin Soup with Truffles
1.5kg pumpkin
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 head of garlic, cut in half horizontally
handful of rosemary sprigs
olive oil, to drizzle
1½ tbsp olive oil
1 onion, peeled and chopped
pinch of freshly grated nutmeg
30g Parmesan, freshly grated
800ml hot chicken stock
100ml double cream
15g butter
For the pumpkin purée, preheat the oven to 170°C. Cut the pumpkin in half horizontally and remove the seeds - save these
to make a snack. Score the flesh, season with salt and pepper, then rub with the cut garlic halves. Lay rosemary and thyme
sprigs and a garlic half in each pumpkin half. Drizzle with a little olive oil and place on baking trays.
Roast the pumpkin halves for about 1 hour until tender; the timing will depend on the variety, density and thickness. It is
ready when you can effortlessly slip a knife into the thickest part of the flesh. Take out the rosemary and garlic; reserve the
garlic. While still hot, scoop out the pumpkin flesh and purée in a blender or food processor.
For the soup, heat the olive oil in a large saucepan, add the onion and cook for 5–6 minutes until soft and translucent. Scoop
out the flesh from 2 or 3 roasted garlic cloves and add to the pan with the nutmeg and a little seasoning. Sauté for a further
1–2 minutes.
Stir in the pumpkin purée and Parmesan, then pour in the stock. Bring to the boil, lower the heat and simmer for 10–12
minutes. Stir in the cream and heat for a minute.
In batches, ladle the soup into a blender and blend until smooth. Add the butter and blitz again to a velvety smooth texture.
Pour the soup into a clean pan to reheat.
Pour the hot soup into warmed bowls and dot with some black truffle paste and some shaved parmesan.
