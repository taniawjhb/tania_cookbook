FRESH POTATO GNOCCHI
1kg floury potatoes, medium Nicola are best
3 large eggs, beaten
300g plain flour or less, depending on the
texture of the potatoes
Add the whole potatoes in their skins to a pot of salted boiling
water. Bring back to the boil and simmer for 10-15 minutes until
just soft (will depend on th size of your potatoes). Test with a
knife – the potatoes should be cooked, but not overcooked,
otherwise the they will be mushy and will have absorbed too
much water. Hold them in a dish cloth to peel as they will be
hot.
Using a mouli/potato ricer/sieve press the potatoes into a bowl
or onto a clean work surface. Make a hollow in your pile of
potatoes, then pour in the egg and sprinkle over half the flour.
Start to blend everything with your hands, adding more flour but
as little as you can get away with. Work carefully and quickly, as
the more you handle the dough, the harder and bouncier it will
become. You need the same lightness you would use for pastry.
You should now have a soft dough that holds together, doesn’t
feel sticky and can be easily shaped.
Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Roll a piece at a time into
long, thumb-nail thick cylinders on a lightly floured surface, again
working lightly and quickly. As you roll you will also be gently
stretching the dough. Keep the surface well floured as you don’t
want the gnocchi to stick.
Cut the dough into thumb-nail long lengths. To score the gnocchi
use the back of a fork pressed against the gnocchi. This will
help to carry the sauce that you use, it is not ssential however.
Bring a large, deep pot of salted water to the boil. Working with
a few at a time, drop in the gnocchi and listen for the wonderful
kissing noise they make as they go in. Let them cook for 2
minutes, during which time they will bob back up to the surface,
then scoop them out with a slotted spoon. Taste - they should
be sofficí e leggeri (soft and light), the gnocchi equivalent of al
dente.
