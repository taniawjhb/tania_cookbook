APRICOT & PISTACHIO 
COUSCOUS
INGREDIENTS
1/2 cup red onion, chopped
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 300g box couscous, about 1 1/3 cups
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
1/2 cup shelled raw pistachios (optional)
10 dried apricots, chopped
1/3 cup parsley, chopped
Optional 2 teaspoons harissa paste
METHOD
1. Soak chopped onion in lemon juice:
Place the chopped onion in a small bowl. Pour the 
lemon juice over the onions, set aside and let the 
onions soak in the lemon juice.
2.  Toast pistachios:  Toast the pistachios in a 
small pan on medium-high heat until lightly browned 
and fragrant. (Take care when toasting nuts, they 
can burn quickly if you don't pay attention!) Remove 
from heat and place into a small bowl to cool.
3.  Cook the couscous:  Put 2 cups of water in a 
medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Add one 
tablespoon of olive oil and one teaspoon of salt to 
the water. Once the salt dissolves, stir in the 
couscous, turn off the heat and cover the pot. Move 
the pot off the hot burner and let the couscous 
steam, covered, for 5 to 6 minutes.
4.  Combine ingredients to make salad:  Scoop 
out the couscous into a large bowl and fluff with a 
fork. Stir in the harissa, if using. Stir in the 
pistachios, chopped apricots and parsley. Stir in the 
red onion and lemon juice. Add one more tablespoon 
of olive oil, stir well and add salt to taste. Serve 
warm or at room temperature.
