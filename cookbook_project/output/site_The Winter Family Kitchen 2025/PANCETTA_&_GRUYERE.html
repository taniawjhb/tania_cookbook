PANCETTA & GRUYERE
QUICHE
175g plain flour
100g cold butter, cut into pieces
1 egg yolk
For the pastry, put the flour, butter, egg yolk and 4 tsp cold water
into a food processor. Using the pulse button, process until the
mix binds. Tip the pastry onto a lightly floured surface, gather into
a smooth ball, then roll out as thinly as you can. Line a 23 x
2.5cm loose-bottomed, fluted flan tin, easing the pastry into the
base. Trim the pastry edges with scissors (save any trimmings) so
it sits slightly above the tin (if it shrinks, it shouldn’t now go below
the level of the tin). Press the pastry into the flutes, lightly prick the
base with a fork, then chill for 10 mins. Put a baking sheet in the
oven and heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6.\
Line pastry case with foil, shiny side down, fill with dry beans
and bake on the hot sheet for 15 mins. Remove foil and beans
and bake for 4-5 mins more until the pastry is pale golden. If
you notice any small holes or cracks, patch up with pastry
trimmings. You can make up to this point a day ahead.
While the pastry cooks, prepare the filling.
200g pack lardon, unsmoked or smoked
50g Gruyère
200ml carton crème fraîche
200ml double cream
3 eggs well beaten
pinch ground nutmeg
Heat a small frying pan, tip in the lardons and fry for a couple of
mins. Drain off any liquid that comes out, then continue cooking
until the lardons just start to colour, but aren’t crisp. Remove and
drain on paper towels. Cut three quarters of the cheese into
small dice and finely grate the rest. Scatter the diced cheese and
fried lardons over the bottom of the pastry case.
Using a spoon, beat the crème fraîche to slacken it then slowly
beat in the double cream. Mix in the beaten eggs. Season (you
shouldn’t need much salt) and add nutmeg. Pour three-quarters
of the filling into the pastry case.
Half-pull the oven shelf out and put the flan tin on the baking
sheet. Quickly pour the rest of the filling into the pastry case –
you get it right to the top this way. Scatter the grated cheese over
the top, then carefully push the shelf back into the oven. Lower
the oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Bake for about 25 mins, or
until golden and softly set (the centre should not feel too firm). Let
the quiche settle for 4-5 mins, then remove from the tin. Serve
freshly baked, although it’s also good cold.
