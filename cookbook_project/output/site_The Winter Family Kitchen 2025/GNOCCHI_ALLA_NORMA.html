GNOCCHI ALLA NORMA
INGREDIENTS
800g  eggplant , cut into 2.5cm/1" cubes 
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1/2 tsp each salt and pepper
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
4 garlic cloves , finely minced
1/2 small onion , very finely chopped
65 ml dry white wine , anything not too sweet 
or woody 
700g tomato passata
65 ml water
1 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp red chili flakes , optional (for a hint of 
heat)
Salt and pepper to taste
METHOD
1. Preheat oven to 220Â°C fan. Line a tray with 
baking / parchment paper.  Toss eggplant with oil, 
salt and pepper. Spread on the tray and roast for 20 
minutes.Flip, then roast for a further 5 minutes. Cool 
on tray 
2.  Heat oil in a very large skillet over medium heat. 
Add garlic, cook for 20 seconds until golden, then 
add onion, chili pepper and cook for 2 to 3 minutes 
until translucent and cooked through.
3.  Increase heat to medium-high and add wine, if 
using. Let it simmer, scraping the base of the pan to 
deglaze, until the wine mostly evaporates.
4.  Add tomato passata, dried herbs, red pepper 
flakes, salt and pepper. Stir and simmer 20-25 
minutes.
5.  Stir in eggplant, then add cooked and drained 
gnocchi. GENTLY toss until gnocchi is coated in the 
sauce (so the eggplant doesn't turn into complete 
mush!).
6.  Serve immediately, garnished with a good pinch 
of fresh basil and parmesan.
