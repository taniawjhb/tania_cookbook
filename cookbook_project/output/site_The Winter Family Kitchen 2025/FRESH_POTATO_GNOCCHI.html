FRESH POTATO GNOCCHI 
LIGHT DELICATE DUMPLINGS
INGREDIENTS
1kg floury potatoes, medium 
Nicola are best 
2 large eggs, beaten
300g plain flour - divided, 
200g + 100g 
1tbsp fine salt
Pinch of nutmeg
METHOD
1. Add the whole potatoes in their skins to a pot of salted boiling 
water. Bring back to the boil and simmer for 10- 15 minutes until 
just soft (will depend on th size of your potatoes). Test with a knife 
– the potatoes should be cooked, but not overcooked, otherwise the 
they will be mushy and will have absorbed too much water. Hold 
them in a dish cloth to peel as they will be hot.
2.  Using a mouli/potato ricer/sieve press the potatoes into a bowl 
or onto a clean work surface. Make a hollow in your pile of potatoes, 
then pour in the egg, salt, nutmeg and sprinkle over 200g of flour. 
Start to blend everything with your finger tips,. Work carefully and 
quickly, as the more you handle the dough, the harder and bouncier 
it will become. You need the same lightness you would use for 
pastry.
3.  You should now have a soft dough that holds together, doesn’t 
feel sticky and can be easily shaped. Flour the ourtside of it lightly 
to make it easier to handle.
4.  Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces. Roll a piece at a time into 
long, thumb-nail thick cylinders on a lightly floured surface, again 
working lightly and quickly. As you roll you will also be gently 
stretching the dough. Keep the surface well floured as you don’t 
want the gnocchi to stick.
5.  Cut the dough into thumb-nail long lengths. To score the 
gnocchi use the back of a fork pressed against the gnocchi.  This 
will help to carry the sauce that you use, it is not ssential however.
6.  Bring a large, deep pot of salted water to the boil. Working with 
a few at a time, drop in the gnocchi and listen for the wonderful 
kissing noise they make as they go in. Let them cook for 2 minutes, 
during which time they will bob back up to the surface, then scoop 
them out with a slotted spoon. Taste - they should be sofficí e 
leggeri (soft and light), the gnocchi equivalent of al dente.
