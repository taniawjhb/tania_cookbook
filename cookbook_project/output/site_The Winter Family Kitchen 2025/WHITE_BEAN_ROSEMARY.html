WHITE BEAN & ROSEMARY 
CROSTINI
INGREDIENTS
4 garlic cloves
Â½ tbsp roughly chopped
fresh rosemary
1 tbsp fresh parsley leaves
1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
400g tin cannellini beans,
drained and rinsed
2 salad onions, sliced
30g frozen peas, defrosted
4 thick slices seeded bread
METHOD
1. Crush or whizz together 3 garlic cloves, the 
rosemary and the parsley with the olive oil and a 
splash of water using a pestle and mortar or mini 
food processor.
2.  Cook half the garlic-rosemary paste in a non-stick 
frying pan for 3 minutes over a low heat. Add the 
beans and toss to coat thoroughly, then cook until 
heated through. Roughly crush the beans with a fork 
or potato masher, leaving some whole. Stir in the 
salad onions and peas.
3.  Toast or grill the bread, then rub each slice with 
the remaining garlic clove. Spread with the bean 
mash, then top with a little of the remaining garlic-
rosemary paste.
