INGREDIENTS
1kg Mussels
400g Canned tomatoes, crushed
2 cloves garlic
1 Fresh chili pepper
50ml white wine
3tbsp Extra virgin olive oil)
Black pepper to taste
Fine salt to taste
Parsley to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Pour half of the olive oil into a pot and add a whole 
peeled garlic clove, fry until the garlic clove begins to turn 
golden.  Then add in the mussels, some of your fresh 
chopped parsley and the white wine.  Place the lid on your 
pot and allow the mussels to steam and open.  Once they 
open remove the mussels from the pan and set aside under 
foil to keep them warm.
Step 2:  Set aside any of the liquid that the mussels have 
released and then add the remaining olive oil to your pan 
and return the pan to a medium low heat.
Step 3:  Finely chop the unused clove of garlic and the chilli 
and add it to the oil, and over a low heat allow the garlic to 
cook until just browning.  Now add the reserved clove of 
garlic, that you had since pasted and allow it to cook for a 
minute.
Step 4:  Once the garlic is lightly golden and fragrant add your 
pureeed tomatoes and any reserved liquid and allow the 
tomato sauce to cook for 10-15 minutes.  Add salt and pepper 
to taste, keep it light as you want to allow the mussels to 
share their flavour.  
Step 5:  Return the mussels to the pan and toss to coat, once 
warmed through, garnish with more fresh chopped parsely 
serve with crusty bread.
