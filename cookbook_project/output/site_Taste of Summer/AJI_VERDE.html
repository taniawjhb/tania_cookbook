<h1>AJI VERDE</h1>
<pre>
INGREDIENTS
½ cup mayonnaise
2 cups lightly packed fresh cilantro
2 medium jalapeños, seeds and 
membranes removed but reserved, roughly 
chopped
2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
⅓ cup (1 ounce) grated Cotija or Parmesan 
cheese
1 tablespoon lime juice
¼ teaspoon fine sea salt
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  In a food processor or blender, combine all of the 
ingredients. Blend until the cilantro has broken into very tiny 
pieces and the sauce is green and mostly smooth.
Step 2:  Taste and adjust as needed. This sauce is designed 
to be bold and spicy. If the flavor is too intense, blend in 1 
tablespoon of olive oil while the food processor is running. For 
more heat, add some reserved jalapeño seeds and blend 
again. If it lacks tang, add another tablespoon of lime juice or 
a pinch of salt.
Step 3:   Aji verde keeps well in the refrigerator, covered, for 
about 1 week, serve with grilled chicken, fish or vegetables.
