<h1>GREEN BEAN ALMOND &</h1>
<pre>
INGREDIENTS
⅓ cup sliced almonds
450gms green beans, trimmed and cut into 
7cm long pieces
¼ cup water
½ teaspoon fine sea salt, divided
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice (about ½ lemon)
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1 small-to-medium clove garlic
1/4tsp freshly ground black pepper
Pinch of red pepper flakes
¼ cup crumbled feta cheese, divided
3 to 4 large basil leaves, torn or chopped, 
for garnish
Lemon zest from about ½ lemon, for garnish
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Start with a large skillet over medium heat. Add the 
almonds and cook, stirring frequently (careful, they burn 
quickly). After 3 minutes, reduce the heat to medium-low, and 
continue stirring until they are fragrant and turning golden on 
the edges, about 1 to 3 more minutes. Transfer the almonds to 
a bowl to cool.
Step 2:  Make sure the heat is set to medium-low and place 
the skillet back on the heat. Immediately add the green 
beans, water and ¼ teaspoon salt. Cover and cook, stirring 
occasionally, until the beans are nearly tender, about 7 to 10 
minutes. Remove the lid, raise heat to medium-high, and cook 
until the liquid evaporates, 2 to 5 minutes. Remove the skillet 
from the heat and set aside.
Step 3:  Meanwhile, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, 
mustard, garlic, black pepper, red pepper flakes and 
remaining ¼ teaspoon salt. Set aside.
Step 4:  Once the green beans are done cooking, whisk the 
olive oil mixture once more, then pour it into the skillet. Pour 
the almonds back into the skillet, and add about half of the 
feta, reserving the other half for garnish. Toss to combine, then 
taste and add more lemon juice or black pepper if necessary.
Step 5:  Transfer the green beans to a serving bowl or platter. 
Sprinkle the remaining feta and the torn basil leaves on top. 
Lightly grate some lemon zest on top, and serve promptly.
