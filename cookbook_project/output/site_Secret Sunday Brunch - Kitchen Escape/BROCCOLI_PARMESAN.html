BROCCOLI & PARMESAN
FRITTATA
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/2 cup sliced red onions
1/2 teaspoon salt
225gms broccoli, ends cut off, cut into bite size pieces
8 large eggs
3/4 cup ricotta cheese (you can use cottage cheese if you prefer)
1 tbsp minced fresh chives
1/4 teaspoon dried tarragon
1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
Heat butter into a 10-inch oven-proof frying pan over medium heat. Add shallots and cook, stirring occasionally,
until they soften and turn translucent, about 3 minutes. Add broccoli and cook for an additional 3 minutes.
Beat the eggs and ricotta cheese together, stir in the chives and tarragon. Pour the egg mixture into the pan and
cook until almost set, but still runny on top, about 4 to 5 minutes. While cooking, pre-heat oven broiler.
Sprinkle parmesan cheese over the eggs and put in oven to bake until cheese is melted and browned, and the
center is set, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove pan from oven with oven mitts and slide frittata onto a serving plate.
Cut into wedges. (Be very careful with the hot pan handle! I usually ice down the handle of any long handled
pan I take out of the oven so that no one mistakenly tries to pick up the pan by the hot handle.)
