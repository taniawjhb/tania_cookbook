CROSTINI WITH SMOKED
SALMON & CREAM CHEESE
1 loaf sour dough baguette
2 cloves garlic
45ml olive oil
salt & pepper
250gms cream cheese, softened
small bunch of chives
tsp finely chopped parsley
juice of 1 lemon
2-3 avocados
200gms smoked salmon, finely sliced
Preheat a griddle pan until smoking hot.   Slice the bread, on the angle, and brush with olive oil.  Griddle the
bread until slightly charred and golden brown, adjust the heat accordingly.  Once the bread is toasted, rub it
lightly with the clove of garlic on one side.  Season with a little salt and set aside.
To make the cream cheese avocado mix, start by mixing the softened cream cheese with the lemon juice,
chopped parsley and chives.  To prepare the cucumber, remove some, but not all the skin.  Cut in half and
remove the seeds and discard.  Now finely dice the cucumber into small pieces, and stir into the cream cheese
mixture.  Once the mixture has softened, peel and dice the avocado into small chunks.  Gently mix the avocado
into the  cream cheese mixture, check for seasoning and acidity, adjust if required.
To assemble, top each bruschetta with a generous topping of the cream cheese mixture, then top with a few
ribbons of smoked salmon, garnish with a little fresh dill, serve with lots of cut lemons to drizzle.
