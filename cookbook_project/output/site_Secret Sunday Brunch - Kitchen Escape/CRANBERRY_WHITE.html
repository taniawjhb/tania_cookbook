CRANBERRY & WHITE
CHOCOLATE BLONDIES
3/4 cup butter, cubed
1-1/2 cups packed light brown sugar
2 large eggs, room temperature
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
2-1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup dried cranberries
6 ounces white baking chocolate, coarsely
chopped
1 tablespoon grated orange zest, optional
80-100gms white baking chocolate, melted
Preheat oven to 350Â°. In a small pot, melt the butter, remove
from heat; stir in the brown sugar. Cool slightly.
Beat in 1 egg at a time, and vanilla.
In another bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt and
cinnamon; stir into butter mixture. Stir in cranberries and chopped
chocolate (batter will be thick). Spread into a greased 13x9-in.
Pan.
Bake until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in center
comes out clean (do not overbake), 18-21 minutes. Cool
completely on a wire rack.
Zest the orange and add it to a metal or glass bowl.  Add the
chocolate and place the bowl over a pot of barely simmering
water.  Make sure the bowl does not touch the water.  Wait 3-
minutes, then check to see if the chocolate has melted by
stirring.  Once the chocolate is completely melted, remove the
bowl and set aside.
Once the blondies have cooled, drizzle with the melted
chocolate and cut into triangles.
