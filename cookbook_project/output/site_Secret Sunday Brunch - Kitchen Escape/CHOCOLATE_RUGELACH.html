<h1>CHOCOLATE RUGELACH</h1>
<pre>
CHOCOLATE RUGELACH
1 Egg for Dough, and 1 Egg for basting
1/4 Cup melted butter
1/3 Cup warm milk
1 packet active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)
2 1/2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cup flour
3 tablespoons honey
1/3 cup cocoa powder
1/2 cup butter, softened (or canola oil)
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup sugar
In a ziplock plastic bag, add one egg, melted butter, milk, vanilla, yeast, sugar, salt and flour. Squish and knead
the bag for 5-10 minutes until the dough is evenly mixed.
Place the bag in a bowl of very warm water for 45 minutes or until dough doubles in size. You can add more
warm water if it gets cold.
Preheat oven to 175C. Time to make the filling. Mix the honey, cocoa powder and softened butter in a bowl. If the
butter is too hard, you can melt it. *If you melt it, stick it in the refrigerator before you spread it on the dough.
Separate the dough into 3 even balls. Sprinkle with a little bit of flour. Roll out each ball into a circle, flipping and
stretching until the dough is super thin.
Spread a layer of filling on the dough. Cut into 8 slices, like a pizza. Separate each slice and roll tightly. *You need
to separate the slices so they donâ€™t get covered in chocolate on the outside from the other slices. Place each
rugelach on a non-stick baking tray.
Brush with a beaten egg and bake for 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the glaze by adding the water to a
saucepan on medium heat. Then add the sugar and stir until the sugar melts. Simmer for 1 minute. When the
rugelach are done baking, scoop the glaze onto the rugelach while they are still hot. The rugelach soak up the
delicious glaze.
