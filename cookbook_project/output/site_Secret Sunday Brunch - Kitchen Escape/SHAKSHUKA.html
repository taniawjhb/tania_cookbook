SHAKSHUKA
3 tbsp olive oil
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
2 onions cut into fine rings
4 medium size red/yellow/green pepper
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp unsmoked paprika
1000ml ready made tomato sauce
200gms danish feta
100ml white wine
2 tbsp finely shredded basil
12 large free range eggs
extra olive oil for drizzling
Start by heating the olive oil in a large saucepan with a fitting lid.
Now add the finely chopped onions and the finely sliced peppers and cook until very tender and caramelised
before adding the garlic and cumin.
Cook for two minutes until garlic begins to soften and the spice is nicely roasted.
Now add the paprika, fry for 1-minute before adding the tomato sauce and the wine and bring to a rapid boil.
Cook for 10-minutes over medium heat until the wine has cooked off, reduce the heat to a low simmer, check
sauce for seasoning.
Crack the eggs and add them carefully to the tomato sauce, making little holes in the sauce as you go.  Once all
the eggs are added, scatter with the fresh herbs and the crumbled feta.  Cover the pan and simmer slowly for
7-9 minutes until the egg whites are cooked through and the yolks are still runny.
Serve topped with fresh flat leaf parsley with some garlic toasted ciabatta
