<h1>QUICK CHOCOLATE SLICES</h1>
<pre>
150g butter, cubed, plus extra for the tin
3 tbsp caster sugar
3 tbsp golden syrup
6 tsp cocoa powder
225g biscuits, crushed
handful of raisins
110g milk chocolate
110g dark chocolate
Butter and line a 15-20cm tin with baking parchment. In a large
saucepan, melt the butter, sugar, syrup and cocoa. Stir through the
biscuits and raisins.
Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and press down, then smooth
the top with the back of a spoon. Microwave both chocolates in
short 20 second bursts, stirring frequently, until melted. Pour them
over the mixture in the tin. Use a palette knife or spoon to smooth
over, so it's completely coated in chocolate.
Put the tin into the fridge and leave for about 2 hrs to set, or
overnight. Run a kitchen knife under the hot tap then cut into
squares.
