Caipirinha Beer Can Chicken
1 whole chicken 
Olive oil for drizzling
5 sage leaves, finely chopped 
2 tbsp cachaça (or cane)
1 tbsp soft brown sugar 
Salt and black pepper
Juice of 2 large limes
2 tbsp soft brown sugar 
3 tbsp cachaça (or cane)
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped or crushed 
1/2 tsp fine salt
2 tbsp olive oil
5-6 large sage leaves, chopped
Preheat oven to 200 degrees.  Rub entire chicken with some olive oil, chopped sage, salt and pepper making 
sure to get into the cavity of the bird
Place all ingredients for the steam marinade into a bowl and stir till sugar has dissolved
Take an empty can, making sure all labels are peeled off and the can is washed thoroughly, and add your 
steam marinade to it
Wrap the outside of a heavy-based roasting tin with kitchen foil, then place the can and marinade into the 
middle,. Sit the chicken on top of the can so that the can enters the cavity. Spread out the legs to support the 
birds weight. Take a squeezed lime, and pop it into the neck to form a plug, preventing steam escaping 
(alternatively, wrap the neck in tin foil)
Roast for 45 minutes, until the chicken is almost cooked. Mix remaining cachaça and brown sugar and carefully 
brush over the chicken. Cook for a further 10-15 minutes until golden and the juices from the chicken run clear. 
Transfer to a serving plate and drizzle with the thick sticky marinade
