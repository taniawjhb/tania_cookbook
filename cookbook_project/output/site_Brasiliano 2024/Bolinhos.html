Bolinhos
1 cup long-grain rice
1 small onion
1 stick celery finely chopped
1 small carrot finely chopped 
4 tbs. butter
3 cups chicken broth
70gms grated Parmigiano
80 gms finely diced smoked cheese 
80 gms finely diced chorizo
30gms parsley, chopped
4 eggs
breadcrumbs
nutmeg
olive oil
salt
pepper
Flour
In a heavy based pot saute the onion, carrot and celery in the butter until soft and translucent.  Then add the rice 
and fry it until it is sizzling.  Then add the hot broth slowly, stirring frequently. The rice should be done in about 20 
min. When the rice is ready, mix in half the parmesan, and then spread the rice out in a flat baking tray to cool.
In a heavy based frying pan add over medium high heat, fry the little cubes of chorizo until crispy.
Mix the chopped smoked cheese and chorizo once it has cooled slightly, add the rest of the parmesan, the 
chopped parsley, 1 egg, nutmeg, salt and pepper (If the mixture is a little wet add some more parmesan). With 
slightly damp hands, take a handful of rice in one hand, and a pinch of stuffing with the other. Push the stuffing 
into the middle of the rice. Squeeze the rice all around the stuffing and mould it into an egg shape.
When you have used up all the mix, flour the croquettes, dip into beaten eggs, and then roll again in 
breadcrumbs. Fry the bolinhos in very hot oil, once golden and cooked through place on paper towel to drain 
and serve immediately.
