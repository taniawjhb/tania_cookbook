MANAKISH<br>2 tsp <br>active dry yeast<br>300 ml water (warm)<br>500 g flour<br>2 tsp <br>salt<br>2 tsp <br>sugar<br>12 tbsp olive oil<br>6 tbsp Za'atar<br>300 g halloumi<br>lemon (for serving)<br>The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.<br>Dissolve yeast in lukewarm water. Add flour, salt, and sugar to a<br>bowl. Make a well and add yeast mixture, followed by one third of<br>the olive oil. Work into a dough using your hands and knead for 5<br>min. until elastic. The dough should spring back when poked with<br>your finger. Form dough into a ball, place in a large bowl, oil the top,<br>and cover with plastic wrap. Set aside somewhere warm for 1 hr.<br>Once the dough has risen, roll out into a log and divide into<br>4 equal pieces. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and press<br>out slightly into flatbreads. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let<br>rise again while you prepare the topping. Mix the Za’atar with<br>remaining olive oil. Grate halloumi on the largest side of a box<br>grater, then add to the Za’atar mixture and mix to combine.<br>Preheat oven to 200°C/400°F. Stretch out the flatbreads and<br>dimple the surfaces with your fingertips. Top each generously with<br>the Za’atar-halloumi mixture and drizzle more olive oil, if desired.<br>Transfer to oven and bake for approx. 8 min. Serve immediately with<br>lemon wedges. Enjoy!
