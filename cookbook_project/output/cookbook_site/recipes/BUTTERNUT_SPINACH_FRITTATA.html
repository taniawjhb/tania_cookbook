Secret Sunday Brunch in partnership with Pierre Jourdan<br>#anytimebubbly<br>BUTTERNUT, SPINACH FRITTATA<br><br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2><br>10 large eggs<br>½ cup half and half (or milk)<br>¾ tsp kosher salt<br>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br>3 tablespoon olive oil, divided<br>5 cups butternut squash, cubed<br>6 cups loosely packed spinach leaves<br>1 teaspoon brown sugar<br>⅛ teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg<br>1 cup ricotta<br>additional salt and pepper to taste<br><br><br><h2>Method</h2>:<br>Preheat the oven to 200C.<br>On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spread out<br>the butternut squash. Drizzle with 2 tablespoon olive oil,<br>brown sugar, nutmeg, ½ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon<br>pepper. Toss to coat.<br>Roast the squash in the oven for 20-25 minutes, until<br>browned and easily pierced with a fork.<br>While the squash is roasting, prepare the frittata base. In a<br>medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, half and half, ¼<br>teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon of pepper. Set aside.<br>Remove the squash from the oven and lower the oven<br>temperature to 180C. In a 10-inch oven-safe skillet, heat the<br>remaining 1 tablespoon oil on medium heat. Saute the<br>spinach until wilted and coated with the oil. Add the cooked<br>butternut squash, and gently mix to incorporate.<br>Turn the heat down to medium-low. Add the egg mixture to<br>the pan. Make sure the ingredients are evenly spread out<br>before adding the egg mixture. Cook the frittata on the stove<br>for about 10-12 minutes. Use a spatula to pull the eggs away<br>from the sides, allowing the liquid to drip to the bottom. This<br>ensures that the frittata is cooking evenly. Cook on the stove<br>until the sides are set and the frittata begins to firm up. Drop<br>the ricotta by tablespoons on top in 4-5 areas, covering the<br>pan. Season with additional salt and pepper.<br>Remove the pan from the stove and finish cooking in the<br>oven for about 15 minutes. The frittata will be ready when it is<br>browned on top and firm (not runny in the middle). The frittata<br>will puff up, then deflate - this is normal. Serve warm or at<br>room temperature.
