BUTTERNUT, SPINACH FRITTATA
iNGREDIENTS
10 large eggs
½ cup half and half (or milk)
¾ tsp kosher salt
½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
3 tablespoon olive oil, divided
5 cups butternut squash, cubed
6 cups loosely packed spinach leaves
1 teaspoon brown sugar
⅛ teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
1 cup ricotta
additional salt and pepper to taste
Method:
Preheat the oven to 200C.
On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spread out
the butternut squash. Drizzle with 2 tablespoon olive oil,
brown sugar, nutmeg, ½ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon
pepper. Toss to coat.
Roast the squash in the oven for 20-25 minutes, until
browned and easily pierced with a fork.
While the squash is roasting, prepare the frittata base. In a
medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, half and half, ¼
teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon of pepper. Set aside.
Remove the squash from the oven and lower the oven
temperature to 180C. In a 10-inch oven-safe skillet, heat the
remaining 1 tablespoon oil on medium heat. Saute the
spinach until wilted and coated with the oil. Add the cooked
butternut squash, and gently mix to incorporate.
Turn the heat down to medium-low. Add the egg mixture to
the pan. Make sure the ingredients are evenly spread out
before adding the egg mixture. Cook the frittata on the stove
for about 10-12 minutes. Use a spatula to pull the eggs away
from the sides, allowing the liquid to drip to the bottom. This
ensures that the frittata is cooking evenly. Cook on the stove
until the sides are set and the frittata begins to firm up. Drop
the ricotta by tablespoons on top in 4-5 areas, covering the
pan. Season with additional salt and pepper.
Remove the pan from the stove and finish cooking in the
oven for about 15 minutes. The frittata will be ready when it is
browned on top and firm (not runny in the middle). The frittata
will puff up, then deflate - this is normal. Serve warm or at
room temperature.
