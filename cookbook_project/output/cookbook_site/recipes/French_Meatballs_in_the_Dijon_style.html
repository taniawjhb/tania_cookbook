French Meatballs in the Dijon style<br>700 gms ground beef<br> Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste<br>1 cup parsley/thyme/sage leaves, finely minced<br>2 minced garlic cloves<br>1 egg<br>1/2  cup vegetable oil<br>1 cup finely minced onion (about 1/2 large onion)<br>1/2 cup dry white wine<br>3 tablespoons Dijon mustard<br>1 1/2 cups heavy cream<br>In a mixing bowl, we combined the beef, salt and pepper, parsley garlic and egg. We mixed it all well together and shaped the meat into<br>12 meatballs.<br>In heavy pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat until the vegetable oil shimmers.   We cooked the meatballs, about 3 minutes<br>on each side, until they were light brown. The meatballs won’t stick to the pan, because you’re using so much oil (and more fat will be<br>rendered from the meatballs). Fortunately, most of that fat gets poured off.<br>Once the meatballs are browned off remove and add keep warm<br>Once all thee meatballs are cooked, remove most of the oil from the pan then add the finely chopped onion. Let the onions cook over<br>medium heat until tender, but not brown, about 3 minutes. Then add the wine and let it all simmer and cook down a bit.<br>Now whisk in the Dijon mustard once it is amalgamated whisk in the cream, and then add back the meatballs.  Cook the meatballs in the<br>cream over medium heat, uncovered, about  5 minutes, or until the cream had reduced by about 1/3.  Cover the pan and simmer on a<br>low flame until the meatballs are cooked through.<br>The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.
