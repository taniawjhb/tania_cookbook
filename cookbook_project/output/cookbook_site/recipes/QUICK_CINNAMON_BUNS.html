Secret Sunday Brunch in partnership with Pierre Jourdan<br>#anytimebubbly<br>QUICK CINNAMON BUNS<br>DOUGH<br>480g cake flour, sifted<br>1 tsp salt<br>177ml lukewarm milk<br>90ml lukewarm cream<br>50g sugar<br>23 g fresh yeast (1 1/2 envelope active dry yeast)<br>90 g melted butter<br>2 egg yolk<br>1 tsp vanilla extract<br>FOR THE TOPPING:<br>160g softened butter<br>180g soft dark sugar<br>6 tsp finely ground cinnamon<br>1 tsp vanilla extract<br>STEP 1:  In a medium bowl stir fresh yeast with 2 tbsp of the sugar until <br>it liquefies. Stir in the lukewarm milk and cream and then add the egg <br>yolks and melted butter - Whisk to combine.<br>STEP 2:  In a large bowl whisk together the flour and salt.<br>STEP 3:   Pour the milk mixture over the dry <br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2> and start <br>kneading it until it pulls away from the edges of the bowl. Give the<br>dough the shape of a ball. Sprinkle oil onto a clean bowl, place the <br>dough and cover with plastic wrap. Let it rest for about 1 hour at room <br>temperature (warm space) until doubled in size.<br>STEP 4:  While the dough rises, add your vanilla extract to the soft butter <br>and work it in, until the butter is light and creamy and the vanilla has <br>been incorporated.  Set aside.  Combine cinnamon and brown sugar. <br>Set aside.<br>Preheat the oven to 190C.  Butter two 12 cup muffin tins, generously <br>with the reserved butter.  <br>STEP 6:  On a floured surface, using a rolling pin roll the dough to a <br>square of 50 x 50 cm. Roll the dough gently allow the rolling pin to do <br>the work.  Then trim the pastry into a neat square.<br>STEP 7:  Dab the butter around the pastry and then spread it until you <br>have a thin, even layer about 2mm thick.  Now take your reserved <br>cinnamon sugar and scatter it evenly over the entire piece of pastry.  <br>Very gently with your hands smooth out the sugar so that the pastry is <br>evenly coated.  Now gently press the sugar down into the butter.<br>STEP 8:  Measure your dough and then, measure a third of the way <br>along the pastry andcarefully fold the pastry.  Press down gently on the <br>folded half, now lift the pastry over again to close it, check to ensure it <br>lines up evenly in thirds and press down again gently.<br>STEP 9:  Trim the open edges with a sharp knife coated in flour.  Now <br>cut the pastry into 2.5cm strips.  Taking one strip at a time, gently pat <br>the strip flat, until it is nicely tightened.  With your sharp floured knife, cut <br>the pastry twice all the way through the bottom resulting in three even <br>strips.<br>STEP 10:  Now plait these strips all the way through and then take the <br>closed end and roll it inwards.  Place in a muffin cup.  Once all the <br>strips are plaited, beat your egg and glaze the tops of the buns lightly.<br>STEP 11:  Bake in the preheated oven for 25 - 30 minutes, until cooked <br>through and nicely golden.  Allow to cool for a few minutes in the tin <br>and then carefully remove to a cooling rack.<br>STEP 12:  Once warm dust with icing sugar or a runny icing glaze for a <br>decadent treat drizzle them whilst warm with a warm caramel sauce.
