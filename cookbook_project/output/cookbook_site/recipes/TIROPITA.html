8-10 sheets of phyllo pastry<br>340g feta cheese, crumbled<br>100g mild goats cheese,<br>120g Parmesan, or regato or Kefalograviera<br>2 egg, beaten<br>a splash of milk<br>fresh mint or dill, chopped (optional)<br>olive oil or melted butter<br>freshly ground pepper<br>To prepare the tiropita, start by preparing the filling. Crush the<br>feta cheese into a large bowl and add the grated cheese, the<br>egg, a splash of milk, and season with freshly ground pepper.<br>Mix well with a spoon to combine the <br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2>. (At this point<br>you can add some chopped fresh herbs if you like; some fresh<br>dill or mint will surely lift the flavour).<br>Preheat the oven at 180C and start preparing the tiropita.<br>Spread one sheet of the phyllo dough on the kitchen counter<br>and with a cooking brush drizzle with some melted butter or<br>olive oil. Spread one more sheet on top and drizzle with some<br>more butter.<br>Cut the sheets into three or four lanes (depending on if you like<br>the tiropita to be small or larger). At the end of each lane add<br>one tablespoon of the filling. Fold one corner to form a triangle<br>and continue folding the triangle upon itself, until the entire piece<br>of phyllo is used. Continue with the rest phyllo sheets and filling.<br>Oil the bottom of a large baking tray, place the tiropita and brush<br>them with some melted butter on top. Bake in preheated oven at<br>180C for 25-30 minutes, until golden and crispy.<br>Cut each phyllo sheet into six, 5 cm strips along the long side.<br>Brush generously with the melted butter. Add one tablespoon of<br>the filling to one side of the long strip and begin to fold into a<br>triangle as the diagram below suggests. Continue until you have<br>used up all of the filling.<br>TIROPITA
