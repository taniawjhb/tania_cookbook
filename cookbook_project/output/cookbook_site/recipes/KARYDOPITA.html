For the syrup<br>500 ml water<br>300 g sugar<br>5 ml freshly squeezed lemon juice<br>1 slice lemon<br>1 cinnamon stick<br>For the cake:<br>350 g coarsely crushed walnuts<br>6 large eggs<br>1/2 tsp ground cloves optional<br>5 ml ground cinnamon<br>10 ml baking powder<br>300 ml milk<br>400 g granulated white sugar<br>250 ml vegetable oil<br>375 g all-purpose flour<br>Instructions<br>Step 1:  Prepare your syrup by combining all of the <br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2> <br>in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil and when the sugar has <br>dissolved, reduce heat to medium.  Allow to cook for <br>approximately 5 minutes and then remove syrup from heat.  <br>Allow to cool.  Note: this produces a cake that is not overly <br>syrupy, however, if you do prefer a syrupy cake, please feel <br>free to increase the quantities for the syrup above.<br>(500 ml water,300 g sugar,5 ml freshly squeezed lemon juice,1 <br>slice lemon,1 cinnamon stick)<br>Step 2:  Preheat your oven to 180C.<br>Step 3:  In a large bowl combine all of the cake ingredients.  <br>The order is not particularly important.  Stir until very well <br>combined with a rubber spatula or large plastic or wooden <br>spoon.  Mix very well until the entire batter is uniform.<br>Step 4:  Grease your baking pan (we used a 25cm round cake <br>pan) with vegetable oil, being sure to cover the bottom and <br>sides.<br>Step 5:  Pour in your batter.  Spread it around so that it is <br>evenly distributed.  Bake in center of oven for approximately <br>50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of <br>the cake comes out clean.<br>Step 6:  When your cake is done, remove it from the oven and <br>gently poke holes in it, using a skewer or a sharp knife. Pour <br>the cooled syrup all over the cake, about 1/2 cup (125 ml) at a <br>time.  The syrup will be absorbed by the cake.<br>Step 7:  Allow your cake to cool and serve it directly from your <br>baking pan.<br>KARYDOPITA
