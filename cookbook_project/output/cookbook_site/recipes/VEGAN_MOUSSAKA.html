Slice the<br>aubergines into rounds about 1/2cm thick.  Brush with oil on both<br>sides, season with salt and black pepper and lay on baking trays.<br>Roast for 25 minutes or so, turning half way through cooking, until<br>golden brown all over and soft.<br>Meanwhile, finely chop the onion, carrot and courgette.  Heat the<br>olive oil in a large lidded casserole or frying pan, and gently cook<br>the onion and carrot for 4-5 minutes until starting to soften, then<br>add the courgette and garlic and continue to cook for a further 4-5<br>minutes.<br>Add the cinnamon, oregano and tomato purée to the pan, stir well,<br>then add the lentils and red wine.  Turn up the heat to bring to the<br>boil, then reduce to a simmer.  After 2-3 minutes, add the water<br>and stock powder then cover and cook gently for 20-25 minutes<br>until the lentils are soft.  If the mixture becomes too dry before the<br>end of cooking, add a little more water, and if there is too much<br>liquid left over just remove the lid for a further few minutes of<br>cooking.  Taste and add salt and pepper as required.<br>Whilst the lentil mixture is cooking, bring a saucepan of water to the<br>boil.  Peel and thickly slice the potatoes, then add these to the pan<br>and cook for 5 minutes until almost cooked through but not falling<br>apart.  Drain and set aside in a bowl.<br>Melt the margarine in the same saucepan, and add the flour.  Cook<br>gently, stirring constantly for 2-3 minutes, then add the milk a little at<br>a time until you have a thick and glossy sauce.  Remove from the<br>heat and stir through the grated cheese and nutmeg.  Taste and<br>add salt and pepper if required.<br>To layer up the moussaka, see the video above: Place half the<br>aubergine slices in the bottom of an ovenproof dish, followed by<br>half the lentil mixture.  Top with the remaining aubergine slices,<br>then the remaining lentil mixture, then the potato slices, and<br>finally pour over the béchamel sauce.<br>Bake in the oven for 35-40 minutes until the top is turning<br>golden brown.  Serve immediately with crusty bread and a crisp<br>green salad.
