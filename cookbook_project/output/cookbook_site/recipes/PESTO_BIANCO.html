The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.<br>PESTO BIANCO<br>1/2 cup walnut halves<br>2 cloves garlic<br>10 basil leaves, chopped<br>Leaves from 1 sprig marjoram<br>2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil<br>1 teaspoon fine sea salt Freshly ground white pepper<br>1 1/2 cups well-drained whole milk ricotta<br>A few tablespoons whole milk or half-and-half (optional; for sauce) 450g <br>pasta, such as fettuccine, spaghetti, penne, cavatelli, or orecchetti<br>Heat the oven to 180C.<br>Spread the walnuts on a small baking sheet and bake for 5 to 7 minutes, until they have turned a shade darker <br>and are fragrant. Let them sit until cool enough to handle, then rub off as much of the thin skins as possible.<br>In a food processor or blender, blitz the nuts to grind them up. Add the herbs, oil, salt and pepper and process or <br>blend again. Add the ricotta and process/blend briefly to incorporate the <br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2>. Transfer to a bowl and stir <br>vigorously to incorporate air and make the pesto fluffy.<br>If not using immediately, spoon the pesto into a container with an air-tight lid and refrigerate. Otherwise, if you're <br>going to use the pesto as a sauce for pasta, transfer it to a bowl and stir in 3 or 4 tablespoons of whole milk to <br>loosen it.<br>To make pasta with white pesto, bring a pot of water to a rolling boil and salt it generously. Cook the pasta (I used <br>a shape called 'rocchetti' which is, essentially, large cavatelli) until al dente. Drain, reserving a little of the cooking <br>water, and return the pasta to the pot. Spoon the pesto into the pasta (you might not use all the pesto) and stir to <br>incorporate it. Stir in the Parmigiano and add a splash or two of the pasta water to loosen the sauce if necessary. <br>Spoon into bowls and serve with more Parmigiano for sprinkling on top.
