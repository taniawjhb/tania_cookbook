CHICKPEA SALAD WITH SUMAC
ONIONS
In a mixing bowl, rub a pinch of salt and ground sumac into the
onion slices with your hands really well. This will soften the onions
and make them more palatable, will also help infuse tangy sumac
to the onion slices.
Place the precooked chickpeas or garbanzo beans on a colander,
drain its liquid and rinse over running water. Combine the
chickpeas with the onions in the mixing bowl. Stir in the ground
cumin and season with salt to your taste, mix well.
Stir in the chopped tomatoes, peppers, spring onion and spinach
into the bowl and combine well with the chickpeas and onion
mixture.
For the dressing; combine the extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice
in a small container. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper to
your taste.
Pour in the seasoning over the salad and combine well. Transfer
the salad into a serving plate. Serve with an extra pinch of ground
sumac sprinkled over, if you like, with plenty flat breads or pita
bread by the side, to mop up the delicious juices.
