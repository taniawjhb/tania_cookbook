<h2>Ingredients</h2><br>For the cake<br>380g chopped walnut (13 ounces)<br>180g powdered Melba toast or <br>breadcrumbs <br>20g baking powder <br>1 flat tsp powdered nutmeg<br>2 tsps powdered cinnamon<br>1/2 tsp grounded clove<br>200g butter<br>165g sugar<br>7 eggs (separated into whites and yolks)<br>zest of 1 orange<br>75ml brandy (1/3 of a cup)<br>For the syrup<br>2 cups sugar<br>100 grams honey (3.5 oz)<br>2 cups water<br>1 tsp vanilla extract<br>1 tbsp orange juice<br>1/4 of a cup cognac<br>INSTRUCTIONS<br>Step 1:  Use an electric mixer to mix the sugar and butter; <br>mix at medium-high speed for at least 5 minutes, until <br>smooth and creamy. Add the egg yolks, one at a time, <br>whilst continue mixing; wait each time for each egg to <br>be absorbed, before adding the next. Pour in the brandy  <br>and the orange zest and mix for 10 more seconds. Set <br>aside.<br>Step 2:   Into a large bowl, add the chopped walnut, the <br>powdered Melba toast, the cinnamon, the clove, the <br>nutmeg, the baking powder and blend with a spoon. <br>(Chop the walnut, using a blender, but be careful not to <br>powder it; the authentic greek walnut cake calls for <br>roughly chopped walnuts.)<br>Step 3:   Combine the two mixtures and blend, until <br>smooth.<br>Step 4:   Place the egg whites into the bowl of the electric <br>mixer, along with a pinch of salt. Make sure your egg <br>whites, bowl and whisk attachments are clean and free <br>of any water. Whisk the egg whites until the mixture is <br>very thick and glossy and a long trailing peak forms <br>when the whisk is lifted (meringues).<br>Step 5:   With a spatula add gradually the meringues into <br>the mixture and blend with light circular movements from <br>the bottom up.<br>Step 6:   Butter the bottom and the sides of a round <br>baking tray, approx 30cm diameter and bake in a <br>preheated oven at 170C, for about 35 minutes, until <br>nicely colored on the outside and baked through.<br>Step 7:  Let the karidopita (greek walnut cake) to cool and <br>then prepare the syrup. Add all the ingredients for the <br>syrup into a pot, and boil, until the sugar has dissolved. <br>Scar the cake into pieces, and slowly ladle the hot syrup <br>over the cold cake, allowing time for each ladle of syrup <br>to be absorbed.<br>Step 8:   Let it cool down for a while, before serving. This <br>Greek walnut cake is ideally served cold with some <br>vanilla ice-cream aside. Enjoy!!<br>KARIDOPITA
