PECAN & CRANBERRY SCONES
¾ cup milk
1 teaspoon white vinegar
2 cups all-purpose flour
¼ cup white sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
½ teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon grated nutmeg
½ cup butter, chilled and cut into small pieces
1 cup dried cranberries
½ cup chopped pecans
1 egg white, beaten
1 ½ cups confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoons milk
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Combine 3/4 cup milk and vinegar in a bowl; let stand until milk is curdled, about 5 minutes.
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg in a large bowl; cut in butter with a pastry
blender. Smooth remaining butter clumps with hands; stir in milk mixture, cranberries, and pecans. Knead until
dough comes together in a ball.
Place dough onto a floured work surface. Roll out with a rolling pin to 1.8cm thickness. Cut into long, 2-inch wide
strips with a sharp knife; cut strips into triangles. Transfer to the baking sheet. Brush tops with egg white.
Bake in the preheated oven until tops are golden brown, about 15 minutes.
Combine confectioners' sugar and 2 tablespoons milk in a small bowl; mix until combined. Drizzle over scones.
