CHICKEN CACCIATORE <br>THE HUNTERS CHICKEN<br><br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2><br>4 bone in chicken thighs large (1 kg / 2 lb)<br>4 chicken drumsticks<br>1/2 tsp salt<br>Large pinch tsp black pepper<br>1 tbsp olive oil<br>Cacciatore:<br>1 onion , halved, finely sliced<br>2 rosemary sprigs (about 15 cm/6″ long), or 1 <br>tsp dried rosemary<br>2 bay leaves , preferably fresh else dried<br>3 garlic cloves , finely minced<br>3 anchovy fillets (or 1 tsp anchovy paste), <br>optional <br>250g / 8 oz mushrooms , sliced<br>2 medium red peppers or 1 large red pepper, <br>sliced 8 mm thick (medium, not giant)<br>90 g tomato paste<br>180 ml dry red wine<br>500 ml chicken stock/broth , low sodium<br>400g/14 oz canned crushed tomato<br>16 whole kalamata olives , pitted, drained<br>1/4 tsp cooking/kosher salt<br>1/4 tsp black pepper<br>1 tsp dried oregano<br><br><br><h2>Method</h2><br>1. Season – Spread the chicken out on a tray. <br>Sprinkle both sides with the salt and pepper.  Heat <br>the oil over high heat in a large, deep, heavy based <br>pan, preferably one with a lid. Place the chicken <br>thighs in the pan, skin side down, and cook until the <br>skin is golden brown, around 6 minutes. Turn and <br>cook the flesh side for just 1 minute, then remove <br>the chicken onto the same tray. Repeat until all <br>chicken is browned. Remove onto the tray.<br>Step 1:  Turn the heat down to medium and let the <br>pan cool slightly. Add the onion, rosemary leaves, <br>bay leaves and dried oregano. Cook for 3 minutes <br>until the onion is starting to soften.<br>Step 2:  Clear a space in the middle of the pan. Add <br>the anchovies and garlic, cooking, mashing up the <br>anchovies, until the garlic is light golden, then stir it <br>into the onion.<br>Step 3:  Turn the heat back up to high. Add the <br>mushroom and capsicum. Stir until softened – about <br>5 minutes (the mushrooms will go watery then the <br>water will evaporate). Add the tomato paste and <br>cook for 2 minutes to cook out the sour flavour – do <br>not shortcut this.<br>Step 4:  Add the wine. Stir, bring to simmer then <br>allow to reduce by around 75%. Add the stock, <br>canned tomato, salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a <br>simmer.<br>Step 5:  Simmer – Then carefully place the chicken <br>into the sauce (skin side up) and pour any juices on <br>the tray in as well. When the liquid returns to a <br>simmer, cover, reduce the heat to medium then <br>simmer energetically for 20 minutes. Remove lid, add <br>olives, simmer for a further 10 minutes (no lid). This <br>will reduce and thicken the sauce.<br>Serve – Serve the chicken with plenty of sauce over <br>mashed potato or polenta, sprinkled with parsley if <br>desired.
