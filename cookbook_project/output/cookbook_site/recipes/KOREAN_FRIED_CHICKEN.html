Heat the oil to 320°F (up to 330°F). Drop the <br>chicken in the oil, one piece at a time. If using wet <br>batter, dip each piece in the wet batter with tongs <br>and shake off excess batter before dropping the <br>chicken in the oil. Fry them in two batches. Cook <br>until lightly golden, about 6 minutes, depending on <br>the size of the chicken wings. Remove them with a <br>wire skimmer or a slotted spoon. Drain on a wire <br>rack or in a large mesh strainer set on a bowl.<br>Step 4:  Reheat the oil to 350°F (up to 360°F). Add <br>the chicken (you can do this in one batch for the <br>second frying), and deep fry again, for about 5 <br>minutes, until golden brown. Drain on a wire rack or <br>in a large mesh strainer set on a bowl.<br>Step 5:  You can either toss the fried chicken pieces <br>in the sauce or hand-brush them. Sprinkle with the <br>optional sesame seeds or chopped scallion to <br>serve.<br>RED SAUCE RECIPE:  Add 1 tablespoon of cooking <br>oil and then the onion, garlic, and ginger. Stir for a <br>minute until fragrant. Add all other sauce <br>ingredients, and stir well. Simmer until it thickens <br>slightly, about 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the heat off. The <br>sauce will get slightly thicker as it cools down.
