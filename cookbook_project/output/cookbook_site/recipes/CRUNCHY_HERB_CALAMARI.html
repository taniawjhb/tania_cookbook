CRUNCHY HERB CALAMARI<br>700g calamari (25 oz.)<br>100g bread flour (3.5 oz.)<br>50g semolina flour (1.5 oz.)<br>1 tbsp peppercorns (or ground pepper)<br>2 tbsps salt<br>1/2 tbsp paprika (optional)<br>1 tbsp oregano (optional)<br>vegetable oil for frying<br>To start clean the calamari and wash thoroughly. Using a sharp<br>knife cut the calamari in slices, approx. 1 cm each. This will<br>create the rings. Place the calamari rings on some paper towel<br>to get ride of the excessive water.<br>Prepare the seasoning for the fried calamari. In a blender add<br>the seasoning and pulse until powdered. (Alternatively you can<br>use a pestle.)<br>In a large sandwich bag or tupperware add the flour and<br>seasoning. Place in the sliced calamari and shake well to coat<br>(you will need to do this in batches). Remove the calamari onto a<br>plate, shaking of any excess flour.<br>Into a medium sized frying pan pour enough vegetable oil to<br>deep fry the calamari. Heat the oil to medium high heat until it<br>begins to bubble. Test if the oil is hot enough by dipping one of<br>the calamari rings in; if it sizzles the oil is ready. Fry the calamari<br>in batches for about 2-3 minutes, until nicely golden.<br>Remove the fried calamari using a slotted spoon and place on<br>some paper towel to dry for 1-2 minutes. Have a taste and<br>sprinkle with some more salt.<br>Serve hot with some lemon wedges.
