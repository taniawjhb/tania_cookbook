INGREDIENTS
3 eggs
⅓ cup white granulated sugar superfine or 
castor sugar is best (75 grams)
½ teaspoon very finely grated lemon zest 
lemon extract or lemon oil can be used
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
95gms cake flour
2 tablespoons cornstarch 
pinch fine salt
50gms powdered sugar, more as needed
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Preheat the oven to 180ºC. Line two large baking trays 
with non stick baking paper.
Step 2:  Separate the eggs, putting the egg yolks into a small 
bowl for later.  Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer with 
the whisk attachment until stiff peaks.
Step 4:  Gradually add the sugar and continue beating until 
the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is thick and glossy.
Step 5:  Mix the lemon zest and vanilla extracts into the egg 
yolks.
Step 6:  Use a spatula to combine the egg yolk mixture with 
the egg whites until just incorporated.
Step 7:  Sift the cake flour, cornstarch and salt over the egg 
mixture.
Step 8:  Use a spatula to gently fold the dry ingredients in until 
just mixed. It is important to fold very gently to not to deflate 
the batter meaning that the savioardi would be flat and not as 
spongy. The mixture will deflate a little but that's fine – you've 
got a lot of air into those egg whites.
Step 9:  Use a piping bag with a plain ½ inch (1.5cm) tip (or 
you could just snip the end off, or use a ziplock bag filled with 
the batter.
Step 10:  Pipe the batter into 5 inch (12cm) lengths leaving 
space between each to allow for spreading.
Step 11:  Sift half of the powdered sugar over the savoiardi 
and wait for 5 minutes. The sugar will melt and look wet. 
That’s what it’s meant to do.
Step 12:  After 5 minutes, sift over the remaining powdered 
sugar. You may need a little bit more. Sprinkling with 
powdered sugar is what creates the characteristic crust of 
savoiardi.
Step 13:  Bake savoiardi cookies for 10 minutes, then rotate the 
baking trays and bake for another 5 minutes.
Step 14:  Allow to cool for 5 minutes then remove with a metal 
spatula while still warm and cool on a wire rack.
