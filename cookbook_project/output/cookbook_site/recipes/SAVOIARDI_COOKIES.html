<h2>Ingredients</h2><br>3 eggs<br>⅓ cup white granulated sugar superfine or <br>castor sugar is best (75 grams)<br>½ teaspoon very finely grated lemon zest <br>lemon extract or lemon oil can be used<br>1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>95gms cake flour<br>2 tablespoons cornstarch <br>pinch fine salt<br>50gms powdered sugar, more as needed<br>INSTRUCTIONS<br>Step 1:  Preheat the oven to 180ºC. Line two large baking trays <br>with non stick baking paper.<br>Step 2:  Separate the eggs, putting the egg yolks into a small <br>bowl for later.  Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer with <br>the whisk attachment until stiff peaks.<br>Step 4:  Gradually add the sugar and continue beating until <br>the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is thick and glossy.<br>Step 5:  Mix the lemon zest and vanilla extracts into the egg <br>yolks.<br>Step 6:  Use a spatula to combine the egg yolk mixture with <br>the egg whites until just incorporated.<br>Step 7:  Sift the cake flour, cornstarch and salt over the egg <br>mixture.<br>Step 8:  Use a spatula to gently fold the dry ingredients in until <br>just mixed. It is important to fold very gently to not to deflate <br>the batter meaning that the savioardi would be flat and not as <br>spongy. The mixture will deflate a little but that's fine – you've <br>got a lot of air into those egg whites.<br>Step 9:  Use a piping bag with a plain ½ inch (1.5cm) tip (or <br>you could just snip the end off, or use a ziplock bag filled with <br>the batter.<br>Step 10:  Pipe the batter into 5 inch (12cm) lengths leaving <br>space between each to allow for spreading.<br>Step 11:  Sift half of the powdered sugar over the savoiardi <br>and wait for 5 minutes. The sugar will melt and look wet. <br>That’s what it’s meant to do.<br>Step 12:  After 5 minutes, sift over the remaining powdered <br>sugar. You may need a little bit more. Sprinkling with <br>powdered sugar is what creates the characteristic crust of <br>savoiardi.<br>Step 13:  Bake savoiardi cookies for 10 minutes, then rotate the <br>baking trays and bake for another 5 minutes.<br>Step 14:  Allow to cool for 5 minutes then remove with a metal <br>spatula while still warm and cool on a wire rack.<br>SAVOIARDI COOKIES
