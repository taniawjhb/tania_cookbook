The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.<br>Thai Tea Cake with Condesed <br>Milk Custard Sauce Recipe<br><br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2><br>1 1/4 whole milk, room temperature<br>1 ceylon tea bag<br>1 small cinnamon stick<br>1 star anise / 1 tsp of anise seeds<br>6 cardamom pods<br>1/2 tsp turmeric<br>1 tsp vanilla extra<br>113g butter, softened<br>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar<br>3 large eggs, room temperature<br>281g  all-purpose flour<br>1/2 teaspoon salt<br>2 teaspoons baking powder<br>For ths custard<br>6 large egg yolks<br>3/4 cup milk<br>1 can condensed milk<br>1 tsp vanilla extract<br>INGREDIENTS<br>STEP 1:  Seperate 1 1/4 cups of milk and place in a small saucepan <br>over low heat.  To this add 1 ceylon tea bag, 1 stick cinnamon, 6 <br>cardamom pods, 1 star anise and a 1/2 tsp of tumeric.  As soon as <br>you see small bubbles around the edge of the pot, switch off the <br>heat and allow the tea to infuse for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, <br>until the liquid is cool.  To this add 1tsp of vanilla extra. <br>STEP 2:  Grease  25cm springform pan , and line it with a piece of <br>parchment paper; set aside. Preheat oven to 180° .<br>STEP 3:  In a medium bowl stir together flour, salt, and baking powder; <br>set aside. In a large mixing bowl beat butter with an electric mixer on <br>medium speed until fluffy, about 30 seconds. Add sugar, 1/4 cup at a <br>time, and continue to beat until the mixture is well combined, <br>scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.<br>STEP 4:  Add eggs to the butter mixture, one at a time, beating after <br>each addition, about 1 minute total.<br>STEP 5:  Strain cooled tea-infused milk through a fine mesh strainer. <br>With a rubber spatula, alternately fold in flour mixture and tea-infused <br>milk to butter mixture. Once the batter is well combined, spread it into <br>the prepared pan, and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center <br>comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove the cake from the oven <br>and let it cool in the pan.<br>STEP 1:  Meanwhile, make the custard sauce by putting 3/4 milk and <br>condensed milk in a heavy-bottomed pot or sauce pan over <br>medium-low heat, whisking to combine. <br>STEP 2:  Place egg yolks in a medium mixing bowl and whisk until <br>smooth.<br>STEP 3:  Once the condensed milk mixture starts to boil, immediately <br>remove the pot from heat. With one hand, slowly pour the hot milk <br>into the yolks in thin stream. With the other hand, whisk the mixture <br>vigorously making sure everything is well blended.<br>STEP 4:  Pour the egg mixture back into the empty milk pot and put it <br>on low heat, whisking constantly. In less than a minute, the custard <br>sauce will thicken up. Take the pot off the heat, strain the custard <br>through a fine-mesh strainer into a serving container, preferable one <br>with a spout; keep covered and warm. (You should end up with <br>approximately 2 1/2 cups of sauce.)
