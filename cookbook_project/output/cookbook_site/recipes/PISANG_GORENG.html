The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.<br>PISANG GORENG<br>:<br>100g All-Purpose Flour<br>2 teaspoons baking powder<br>pinch of salt<br>150 ml water<br>1 Tablespoon vegetable oil<br>1 Banana<br>Sugar and/or shredded coconut for coating<br>In a bowl, add the flour, baking powder, and salt.<br>Add the water and oil and combine with a hand whisk. The consistency should be thick, like heavy cream and<br>be able to coat a spoon. If it is too thick, add a drop more water, too thin, add a little more flour. Set aside.<br>Heat a pan with vegetable oil until it reaches 180 C or 350 F. Make sure you do not overfill the pan with oil. I use<br>a small saucepan and cook in batches, filling the pan 1/3rd deep with cooking oil.<br>Whilst the oil is heating up, peel the banana, cut in half and then slice lengthways in half so you have 4 pieces.<br>Dip each piece in the batter so it is fully coated and carefully place in the pan, cooking both sides until golden<br>brown. ** To tell if the oil is hot enough, drop a tiny bit of batter, the size of a pea into the oil. If it sizzles and floats<br>to the top immediately, the oil is hot enough.<br>Place the fritters on some kitchen paper then dip into a bowl with sugar and coconut if using, to coat.
