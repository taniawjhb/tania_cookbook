The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.<br>Pao de Queijo<br>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese<br>1 10oz round of Queso Fresco, crumbled<br>1 cup full fat milk<br>1/4 cup vegetable oil, plus 1 Tbsp for oiling your hands<br>2 eggs<br>1 lb tapioca flour also known as tapioca starch<br>2 tsp kosher salt<br>Prepare the Dough:  Preheat oven to 175C.<br>Add the tapioca flour and the salt to a large bowl, whisk to combine and set aside.<br>In a medium bowl, combine the cheeses and the eggs and set aside.<br>Add the milk and the oil to a small saucepan and bring to a simmer on stove top over medium heat.<br>When the liquid simmers, remove the pan from heat, and immediately pour the hot liquid into the tapioca mixture and using<br>a wooden spoon, stir to combine – the mixture will not be homogeneous, it'll be gummy and clumpy.<br>Wait 5-10 minutes until the tapioca mixture is cool to touch, and only then add the cheese and egg mixture to the tapioca<br>mixture. Mix with a wooden spoon, or your hands to combine. Now you should have a homogeneous mixture and it should<br>come together as a ball. You'll still see some white tapioca specks in the dough – don't worry, that's totally normal!<br>Oil your hands, then scoop a Tbsp to 2Tbsp size portions, roll them into balls, and arrange them in a baking sheet<br>approximately 2" apart from one another. Bake until golden brown, approximately 30-35 minutes.
