1kg. fresh spinach, washed, dried, trimmed, and<br>coarsely chopped<br>3 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil<br>1 bunch scallions (about 3 oz. or 10 small), white and<br>light-green parts only, trimmed and finely chopped<br>2 cups crumbled feta cheese (10 oz.)<br>1/2 cup finely grated parmesan<br>1 cup grated mozarella<br>2 large eggs, lightly beaten<br>1tsp paprika<br>1/2tsp ground cumin<br>1/3 cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley<br>1/4 tsp. freshly grated nutmeg<br>Kosher or fine sea salt<br>1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil for brushing; more as<br>needed<br>Eighteen 9x14-inch sheets frozen phyllo dough, thawed<br>and at room temperature<br>2 tsp. milk<br>TIP:<br>Heat a 10-inch straight-sided saute pan over medium-high<br>heat. Add a few large handfuls of the spinach and cook, tossing gently with<br>tongs. As the spinach starts to wilt, add the rest a few handfuls at a time. Cook<br>until all the spinach is wilted and bright green, about 4 minutes. With a slotted<br>spoon, transfer the spinach to a colander set in a sink. Let cool slightly and<br>squeeze with your hands to extract as much of the remaining liquid as you<br>can.<br>Wipe the pan dry with a paper towel. Heat the oil in the pan over medium<br>heat. Add the scallions and garlic and cook until soft and fragrant, about 4<br>minutes. Now add the paprika and cumin, Stir in the spinach, turn off the heat,<br>and let cool for 5 minutes. Then stir in the cheeses, eggs, parsley, nutmeg, and<br>1/2 tsp. salt and mix thoroughly.<br>With a pastry brush, lightly coat the bottom and sides of a<br>9x13x2-inch baking pan with some of the oil. Working quickly, lightly oil one<br>side of a phyllo sheet and lay it in the pan oiled side up and off center so that<br>it partially covers the bottom and reaches halfway up one long side of the pan<br>(the edge on the bottom of the pan will be about 1 inch from the side). Lightly<br>oil the top of another phyllo sheet and lay it oiled side up and off center so it<br>reaches halfway up the other long side of the pan. (If your pan has sloped<br>sides, the sheets may be slightly longer than the bottom of the pan; if so, let<br>the excess go up one short side of the pan and then alternate with<br>subsequent sheets.) Repeat this pattern with 4 more phyllo sheets.<br>Next, lightly oil the tops of 3 phyllo sheets and layer them oiled side up and<br>centered in the pan. Spread the filling evenly over the last layer.<br>Repeat the oiling and layering of the remaining 9 phyllo sheets over the filling<br>in the same way you layered the previous 9. With the oiled bristles of the pastry<br>brush, push the edges of the phyllo down around the sides of the pan to<br>enclose the filling completely.<br>With a sharp knife, score the top phyllo layer into 24 rectangles, being careful<br>not to cut all the way through to the filling. Using the same pastry brush, brush<br>the milk along all the score marks (this will keep the phyllo from flaking up<br>along the edges of the squares). Bake the spanakopita until the top crust is<br>golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes. Let cool until just warm. Cut out the rectangles<br>carefully along the score marks and serve.<br>Muska Böreği
