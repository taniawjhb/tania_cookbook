The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.
2 ¼ cups almond flour
⅔ cup granulated sugar
¼ teaspoon salt
2 large egg whites room temperature
1 teaspoon lemon zest
½ teaspoon almond extract
½ cup powdered sugar
Preheat the oven to 150C. Line a large baking sheet with
parchment paper and set aside.
In a mixing bowl, whisk together 2 ¼ cups almond flour, ⅔
cup granulated sugar, 1 tsp lemon zest, and ¼ tsp salt.
In a separate mixing bowl, using a mixer, beat 2 large egg
whites until stiff peaks.
Then transfer the beaten egg whites to the dry ingredients,
add ½ tsp almond extract, and using a spatula, fold it in until
well combined.
Prepare ½ cup powdered sugar on a plate.
Using a 1 ½ tbsp ice cream scoop or a regular spoon, scoop
out the cookie dough and roll it into a 1-inch ball. Roll it in
powdered sugar to cover from all the sides and transfer to a
baking sheet. Repeat the same with the rest of the dough.
Bake at 150C for 30-35 minutes or until the tops are set and
cracked and the bottom is light golden color. Then take out of
the oven and let sit on the counter for about 10-15 minutes,
they will finish setting and baking inside. Then transfer to a
wire rack and let cool off completely.
