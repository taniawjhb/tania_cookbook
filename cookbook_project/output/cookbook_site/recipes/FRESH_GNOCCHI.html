FRESH GNOCCHI<br>1kg floury potatoes, medium Nicola are best <br>3 large eggs, beaten<br>300g plain flour or less, depending on the<br>texture of the potatoes<br>1 level tbsp fine salt Generous pinch nutmeg<br>50g finely grated parmesan (optional)<br>Add the whole potatoes in their skins to a pot of salted boiling <br>water.  Bring back to the boil and simmer for 10-15 minutes until <br>just soft (will depend on th size of your potatoes). Test with a <br>knife – the potatoes should be cooked, but not overcooked, <br>otherwise the they will be mushy and will have absorbed too <br>much water. Hold them in a dish cloth to peel as they will be <br>hot.<br>Using a mouli/potato ricer/sieve press the potatoes into a bowl <br>or onto a clean work surface. Make a hollow in your pile of <br>potatoes, then pour in the egg, salt & nutmeg and sprinkle over <br>half the flour. Start to blend everything with your hands, adding <br>more flour but as little as you can get away with.  Work carefully <br>and quickly, as the more you handle the dough, the harder and <br>bouncier it will become. You need the same lightness you would <br>use for pastry.<br>You should now have a soft dough that holds together, doesn’t <br>feel sticky and can be easily shaped.<br>Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Roll a piece at a time into <br>long, thumb-nail thick cylinders on a lightly floured surface, again <br>working lightly and quickly. As you roll you will also be gently <br>stretching the dough. Keep the surface well floured as you don’t <br>want the gnocchi to stick.<br>Cut the dough into thumb-nail long lengths. To score the gnocchi <br>use the back of a fork pressed against the gnocchi.  This will <br>help to carry the sauce that you use, it is not ssential however.<br>Bring a large, deep pot of salted water to the boil. Working with a <br>few at a time, drop in the gnocchi and listen for the wonderful <br>kissing noise they make as they go in. Let them cook for 2 <br>minutes, during which time they will bob back up to the surface, <br>then scoop them out with a slotted spoon. Taste - they should <br>be sofficí e leggeri (soft and light), the gnocchi equivalent of al <br>dente.
