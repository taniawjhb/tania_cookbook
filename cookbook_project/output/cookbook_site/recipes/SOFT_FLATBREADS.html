As soon as it begins to bubble switch it off and add<br>the yoghurt and stir to combine.<br>Add this mixture to the flour and mix with a spoon until it<br>begins to form a dough, then take over with your hands.<br>Move the dough to the counter and knead for a few<br>minutes until you have a nice smooth dough. Add the<br>dough back to a bowl and cover with clingwrap and let the<br>dough rest on the counter for 30-minutes to an hour.<br>Now divide the dough into 8 equal parts (approx 130gms<br>each), roll into a ball, and then with a rolling pin, roll until<br>abut 2mm thick. Turn 45 each time your roll to help you<br>achieve a round shape.<br>Now heat a heavy based frying over medium high heat<br>until hot, then brush each wrap with some oil and cook in<br>the pan for about 2-minutes a side until dotted with brown<br>spots and cooked through, flip and repeat on the opposite<br>side. Keep warm between two plates lined with a clean<br>dishcloth – the steam will help keep them nice and soft.
