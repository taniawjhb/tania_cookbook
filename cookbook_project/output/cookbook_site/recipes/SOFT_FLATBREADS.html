SOFT FLATBREADS
600gms cake flour
1 tsp baking powder
2 tsp fine salt
140ml extra virgin olive oil
200ml yoghurt
170ml water
2 tsp zaatar / finely chopped rosemary /
oregano (optional)
Oil to cook
t
Add your flour and baking powder to a large bowl, to it
add the salt and if you are adding any herbs add them
now and mix with a whisk to distribute.
In a small pot over medium high heat, add the oil and
water. As soon as it begins to bubble switch it off and add
the yoghurt and stir to combine.
Add this mixture to the flour and mix with a spoon until it
begins to form a dough, then take over with your hands.
Move the dough to the counter and knead for a few
minutes until you have a nice smooth dough. Add the
dough back to a bowl and cover with clingwrap and let the
dough rest on the counter for 30-minutes to an hour.
Now divide the dough into 8 equal parts (approx 130gms
each), roll into a ball, and then with a rolling pin, roll until
abut 2mm thick. Turn 45 each time your roll to help you
achieve a round shape.
Now heat a heavy based frying over medium high heat
until hot, then brush each wrap with some oil and cook in
the pan for about 2-minutes a side until dotted with brown
spots and cooked through, flip and repeat on the opposite
side. Keep warm between two plates lined with a clean
dishcloth – the steam will help keep them nice and soft.
