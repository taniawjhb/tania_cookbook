270 g granulated sugar 4 <br>eggs<br>2 egg yolks<br>400 g milk<br>400 g heavy cream<br>1 pinch salt<br>1 teaspoon(s) vanilla extract<br>1 teaspoon(s) baking powder <br>450 g phyllo dough sheet 150 <br>g butter<br>1 tablespoon(s) dark brown soft sugar<br>2 tablespoon(s) icing sugar<br>1 tablespoon(s) cinnamon<br>Preheat the oven to 200*C (390*F) set to fan.<br>Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, and using a <br>pastry brush, brush a 30x35 cm baking pan generously with butter.<br>Brush a sheet of phyllo dough with butter and place it in the pan. <br>Brush another sheet with butter and place it on top.<br>Do not brush the rest of the phyllo sheets with butter; instead drizzle <br>some butter on to them, one at a time. Crumple each sheet, folding it <br>like an accordion and transfer to the pan.<br>Be careful not to press down on them so they don’t flatten.<br>Continue in the same way, placing each folded sheet of phyllo gently <br>next to the other, until all of the sheets of phyllo dough are in the <br>pan.<br>Drizzle the leftover butter over the top of the folded phyllo in the pan.<br>Bake for 20 minutes or until the phyllo turns golden brown and <br>crunchy. To make sure it does become as crunchy as possible, place <br>the baking pan on the highest rack in the oven so the air is able to <br>reach both the top and bottom of the pan.<br>While the phyllo is baking, prepare the custard. Start by beating the 4 <br>eggs, 2 egg yolks, and sugar in a bowl, using a hand whisk. Beat <br>until the sugar has completely dissolved.<br>Add the vanilla, baking powder, milk, heavy cream, salt similar to a <br>crème anglaise.<br>When the sheets of phyllo dough are ready, remove from the oven. <br>Turn the heat down to 180C.<br>Pour the custard mixture over the phyllo. Allow the pastry to abosorb <br>the custard for a few minutes.<br>Sprinkle soft brown sugar over the top. This will give the surface a <br>sweet crunch.<br>Return to the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes more.<br>When ready, remove from the oven and set aside to cool for a bit. <br>Sprinkle with icing sugar and cinnamon. Cut into pieces and serve.<br>BOUGATSA
