1 tsp vinegar
¼ to ½ tsp pepper powder or crushed

1 cup cooked noodles or half noodle cake (optional)
6 spring roll wrappers
1 cup oil for deep frying or 1 tbsp oil for baking

Fry on a high flame until half done yet crunchy.  Add soya sauce and vinegar. Mix well.

If you wish to use noodles, boil them al dente. Rinse well and drain completely. Add them to the stir fried veggies
and fry for a min. Pour 1 tsp more soya sauce. Sprinkle some salt and pepper.
Cool this completely.
1. Place a damp cloth over the frozen sheets for 5 to 7 mins or follow the instructions mentioned on the pack.
2. Spread one wrapper, place a spoonful of stuffing.
3. Roll one edge towards the inner side covering the stuffing. Bring the sides to the center. Dampen the left over
edge and roll the wrapper to seal.

5. Heat oil until hot enough. To check drop a small piece of wrapper in the oil. If the oil is hot enough It rises in
the oil without browning.
