MERCIMEK CORBASI<br><br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2><br>5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil<br>1 medium yellow onion, chopped<br>3 garlic cloves, minced, divided<br>2 to 3 carrots, peeled and chopped<br>1 medium russet potato, peeled and small <br>diced or chopped<br>Kosher salt<br>2 tablespoons tomato paste<br>6 cups low-sodium vegetable broth<br>2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper, divided<br>1 teaspoon cumin<br>½ teaspoon coriander<br>1 cup red lentils, picked over and rinsed<br>1 large lemon, cut into wedges<br><br><br><h2>Method</h2><br>In a large Dutch oven or cooking pot, heat 2 <br>tablespoons extra virgin olive oil over medium-high <br>heat until shimmering.<br>Add the onions, 2 minced garlic cloves, carrots, and <br>potatoes. Season with a good dash of kosher salt, <br>and cook, stirring occasionally until the vegetables <br>have softened (about 5 to 7 minutes).<br>Add the tomato paste and toss to coat the <br>vegetables with the paste, then add the broth 1 <br>teaspoon of Aleppo-style pepper and the rest of the <br>spices.<br>Add the lentils and stir.<br>Allow the soup to come to a rolling boil for 4 to 5 <br>minutes, then lower the heat and cover the Dutch <br>oven with the lid leaving a small opening.<br>Let the soup simmer on the lowest heat setting for <br>about 15 to 20 minutes or until the lentils and the <br>vegetables are completely tender. (Check <br>occasionally and give the soup a stir as needed. If it <br>is getting too thick, add a little bit more vegetable <br>broth about ½ to 1 cup more).<br>Remove the pot from the heat and carefully blend the <br>soup using an immersion blender until smooth and <br>creamy. (Alternatively, transfer the soup to a standard <br>blender, let some of the steam escape. Blend in <br>batches until all of the soup is smooth.)<br>To finish, in a small skillet, warm about 3 tablespoons <br>extra virgin olive oil over medium heat. Add the <br>remaining Aleppo pepper and minced garlic and <br>cook briefly until the garlic is golden brown and the <br>oil has taken on a red hue from the Aleppo pepper. <br>Remove from the heat and pour the warmed oil all <br>over the soup.<br>Serve with lemon wedges to the side.<br>The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.
