The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.<br>Sage & Butternut Risotto<br>Paul Maciel - The Cookery<br>6-8<br>800gms butternut<br>3tbsp butter<br>1/4 cup olive oil<br>4 cloves of garlic<br>8 cups vegetable stock<br>1/4 cup olive oil<br>1 medium onion, diced<br>1 stick of celery, finely chopped<br>1 carrot, finely chopped<br>Salt and pepper<br>2 cups arborio rice<br>1 cup dry white wine<br>1 tablespoon flat leaf parsley, chopped<br>4 tablespoons cold butter<br>1/2 cup Parmesan, finely grated<br>1. Preheat the oven to 200C. Now cut the butternut into 2cm cube pieces. Add to a roasting pan, dot with the butter, drizzle with olive oil.<br>Now add the finely chopped thyme, salt, pepper and the whole pieces of garlic.<br>2. Bake the butternut in the centre of the oven for 30-40 minutes, until it is charred and caramelised.<br>3. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; add onion, carrot and celery and season with salt and pepper; add some of the<br>roasted garlic from the butternut, and cook until slightly translucent. Cook until the vegetable mix has cooked and softened but not<br>browned.<br>4. Now add a third of the roasted butternut, and stir to coat with oil. Cook for one minute.<br>5. Add the rice and stir to coat with the oil; season with salt and pepper and cook until slightly translucent.<br>6. The rice should be hot and sizzling, you should stir carefully to ensure it does not stick.<br>7 . Add wine to the hot rice, the liquid should hiss and be quickly absorbed. Stir gently until almost all the liquid has cooked off. Add hot<br>stock and broth mixture, a ladleful at a time, completely stirring in the liquid each time. Remember at this stage you are trying to coax the<br>starches out the rice by gently and continuosly stirring.<br>8. Keep adding broth as needed so there is always a 1/2cm liquid layer over the rice.<br>9. After about 8 minutes add another third of the roasted butternut.<br>10. After 15 to 20 minutes, the rice should be close to al dente.<br>11. At this stage add the remaining butternut and stir to combine well.<br>12. Taste and adjust seasoning, remember the butternut is sweet. Remove from heat and stir in butter, then cheese.<br>13. Now cover the pan, and allow it to stand for 2-3minutes.<br>14. While the risotto is standing, heat the remaining butter, and olive oil until hot. Then add the washed and dried sage leaves. Cook for<br>about 60 seconds until the leaves have crisped, remove from heat.<br>To serve, spoon risotto into shallow bowls, add a crispy sag leaf and some of the sage flavoured butter, a shave of Parmesan and enjoy.<br>4tbsp butter<br>2tbsp olive oil<br>20 fresh sage leaves
