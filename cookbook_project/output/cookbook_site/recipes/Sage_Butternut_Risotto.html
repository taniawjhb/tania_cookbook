Sage & Butternut Risotto
Paul Maciel - The Cookery
6-8
800gms butternut
3tbsp butter
1/4 cup olive oil
4 cloves of garlic
8 cups vegetable stock
1/4 cup olive oil
1 medium onion, diced
1 stick of celery, finely chopped
1 carrot, finely chopped
Salt and pepper
2 cups arborio rice
1 cup dry white wine
1 tablespoon flat leaf parsley, chopped
4 tablespoons cold butter
1/2 cup Parmesan, finely grated
1. Preheat the oven to 200C. Now cut the butternut into 2cm cube pieces. Add to a roasting pan, dot with the butter, drizzle with olive oil.
Now add the finely chopped thyme, salt, pepper and the whole pieces of garlic.
2. Bake the butternut in the centre of the oven for 30-40 minutes, until it is charred and caramelised.
3. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; add onion, carrot and celery and season with salt and pepper; add some of the
roasted garlic from the butternut, and cook until slightly translucent. Cook until the vegetable mix has cooked and softened but not
browned.
4. Now add a third of the roasted butternut, and stir to coat with oil. Cook for one minute.
5. Add the rice and stir to coat with the oil; season with salt and pepper and cook until slightly translucent.
6. The rice should be hot and sizzling, you should stir carefully to ensure it does not stick.
7 . Add wine to the hot rice, the liquid should hiss and be quickly absorbed. Stir gently until almost all the liquid has cooked off. Add hot
stock and broth mixture, a ladleful at a time, completely stirring in the liquid each time. Remember at this stage you are trying to coax the
starches out the rice by gently and continuosly stirring.
8. Keep adding broth as needed so there is always a 1/2cm liquid layer over the rice.
9. After about 8 minutes add another third of the roasted butternut.
10. After 15 to 20 minutes, the rice should be close to al dente.
11. At this stage add the remaining butternut and stir to combine well.
12. Taste and adjust seasoning, remember the butternut is sweet. Remove from heat and stir in butter, then cheese.
13. Now cover the pan, and allow it to stand for 2-3minutes.
14. While the risotto is standing, heat the remaining butter, and olive oil until hot. Then add the washed and dried sage leaves. Cook for
about 60 seconds until the leaves have crisped, remove from heat.
To serve, spoon risotto into shallow bowls, add a crispy sag leaf and some of the sage flavoured butter, a shave of Parmesan and enjoy.
