INGREDIENTS
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
4 large leeks, white and light green parts 
only, roughly chopped (about 5 cups)
3 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
900g potatoes, peeled and roughly 
chopped into ½-inch pieces
7 cups chicken or vegetable stock
2 bay leaves
3 sprigs fresh thyme
1 teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup heavy cream
Chives, finely chopped, for serving
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Melt the butter over medium heat in a large soup pot. 
Add the leeks and garlic and cook, stirring regularly, until soft 
and wilted, about 10 minutes. Adjust the heat as necessary so 
as not to brown.
Step 2:  Add the potatoes, broth, bay leaves, thyme, salt and 
pepper to pot and bring to a boil. Cover and turn the heat 
down to low. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are 
very soft.
Step 3:  Fish out the thyme sprig and bay leaves, then purée 
the soup with a hand-held immersion blender until smooth. 
(Alternatively, use a standard blender to purée the soup in 
batches; see note.) Add the heavy cream and bring to a 
simmer. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. If 
soup is too thin, simmer until thickened. If it's too thick, add 
water or stock to thin it out. Garnish with fresh herbs if desired.
