Mexican Chipotle Meatballs
1 teaspoon sunflower oil
1 large brown onion, finely diced
800 g grass-fed beef mince (1.8 lb ground beef)
3 medium dried chipotle chilies (tinned chipotle can also be used), seeds out/ 2 level tsp chipotle paste
2 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander (cilantro)
2 large garlic cloves, finely diced
1 teaspoon ground coriander seed or powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin seed or powder
1 teaspoon sweet or medium paprika
1 ½ teaspoon of sea salt
1 tablespoon virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons lard, ghee or coconut oil
½ brown onion, mentioned above
2 garlic cloves, finely diced
2 medium chipotle chilies, seeds out
½ teaspoon ground coriander seed or powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin seed or powder
½ teaspoon paprika
2 bay leaves
400 g diced tomatoes or tomato puree (about 1 ½ cups)
½ teaspoon sea salt
If using dried chipotle chilies, place them in hot water to rehydrate, for at least an hour before using.
Heat a teaspoon of cooking fat in a large frying pan over medium heat and add the onion. Sauté the onion for
3-5 minutes until translucent. Remove to a bowl. Use half of the onion for the meatballs mix and reserve the rest
for the sauce.
While onion is cooking, pre-chop other ingredients for the meatballs. Slice the chipotle chilies in half and remove
the seeds. Chop with a knife or grind with mortar and pestle into a paste-like consistency.
Combine ground beef with half of the cooked onion, chopped garlic and chipotle chilies, paprika, cumin,
coriander seed, salt and olive oil. Mix and knead through using your hands. Using clean, wet hands roll the mix
into small balls (somewhere between a walnut and a golf ball size). Set aside until ready to cook.
Preheat some hot oil in a large frying pan until sizzling hot. Cook the meatballs on medium-high heat for 3
minutes on each side, until well browned. Remove and set aside.
Add the rest of the cooked onion, garlic, two chopped chilies and the sauce spices to the pan. Stir through and
add the diced tomatoes/puree. Combine and cook for 8-10 minutes uncovered, stirring frequently to make sure
the sauce is evenly cooked. Now add the meatballs and simmer together for 15-minutes until the meatballs are
cooked through. Add water if needed. Serve garnished with fresh cilantro
