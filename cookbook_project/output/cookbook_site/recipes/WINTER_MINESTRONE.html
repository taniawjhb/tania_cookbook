INGREDIENTS
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, chopped
2 carrots, peeled, chopped
2 celery ribs, chopped
90gms thinly sliced pancetta, coarsely 
chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
450g swiss chard, stems trimmed, leaves 
coarsely chopped
1 russet potato, peeled, cubed
1 can diced tomatoes
1 fresh rosemary sprig
1 can cannellini beans, drained, rinsed
500ml beef broth
30g parmesan cheese, rind
2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley
salt and pepper
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Heat the oil in a heavy large pot over medium heat. 
Add the onion, carrots, celery, pancetta, and garlic. Saute until 
the onion is translucent, about 10 minutes. 
Step 2:  Add the Swiss chard and potato; saute for 2 minutes. 
Add the tomatoes and rosemary sprig. Simmer until the chard 
is wilted and the tomatoes break down, about 10 minutes.
Step 3:   Meanwhile, blend 3/4 cup of the beans with 1/4 cup 
of the broth in a processor until almost smooth. Add the 
pureed bean mixture, remaining broth, and Parmesan cheese 
rind to the vegetable mixture. Simmer until the potato pieces 
are tender, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. 
Step 4:  Stir in the whole beans and parsley. Simmer until the 
beans are heated through and the soup is thick, about 2 
minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Discard 
Parmesan rind and rosemary sprig (the leaves will have fallen 
off of the stem.).
Step 5:   Ladle the soup into bowls and serve..
