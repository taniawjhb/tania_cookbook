INGREDIENTS
1 1/2 tbsp olive oil
2 white onions diced
1 carrot diced
2 celery stalks diced
800-900 g ground beef
3/4 cup red wine
4 garlic cloves minced
2 1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp pepper
1 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp ground cloves
1 tbsp dried basil
3/4 tsp all spice
3 bay leaves
600gms canned tomatoes, diced
1 tbsp sugar
2 tbsp tomato paste
1 cup water
1 package spaghetti noodles (454g 
package)
olive oil
grated parmesan or kefalograviera cheese
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Add olive oil to a large pot over medium-high heat. 
Add onion, carrot and celery and cook until softened, about 4-
5 minutes.
Step 2:  Stir in the ground beef, stirring occasionally to break 
up the meat and cook for about 10-12 minutes until cooked 
through.
Step 3:  Pour in the red wine to deglaze the pan. Cook it for a 
few minutes until most of the wine has evaporated.
Step 4:  Stir in the garlic, spices (salt, pepper, cinnamon, cloves, 
dried basil, all spice) and bay leaves until incorporated. Next 
stir in the diced or whole tomatoes (if using whole tomatoes 
crush them up a bit when added to the pot), sugar, tomato 
paste and water and bring to a boil. Once simmering, turn the 
heat to medium-low and let simmer with the lid on until the 
sauce has cooked down and most of the liquid has 
evaporated.
Step 5:  Near the end of the cooking time, cook the spaghetti 
noodles in salted water until al dente. Drain the noodles.
Step 6:  Serve the spaghetti noodles in bowl with a drizzle of 
olive oil and spoon the sauce overtop. Add grated parmesan 
or kefalograviera cheese and enjoy!
