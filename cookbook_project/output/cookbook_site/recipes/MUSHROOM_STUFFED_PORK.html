MUSHROOM STUFFED PORK<br>TENDERLOIN<br>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more<br>for brushing<br>4 slices bacon, chopped<br>8 ounces cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced<br>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br>1 clove garlic, finely chopped<br>1 tablespoon breadcrumbs<br>1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley<br>2 pork tenderloins (2 to 2 1/2 pounds total),<br>trimmed<br>1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest<br>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over<br>medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until crisp, about 8<br>minutes. Add the mushrooms, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper to<br>taste; cook until the mushrooms are soft, about 4 minutes. Add<br>the garlic and cook 1 minute.<br>Remove from the heat and stir in the breadcrumbs and<br>all but 2 tablespoons parsley. Let cool.<br>Soak 10 to 12 toothpicks in water to prevent them from burning.<br>Rinse the pork and pat dry. Butterfly the pork: Make a 1-inch-<br>deep incision down the length of each tenderloin; do not cut all<br>the way through. Open the meat like a book so the tenderloins<br>lie flat.<br>Cover the pork with plastic wrap; pound with the flat<br>side of a meat mallet until about 1/2 inch thick, starting from the<br>middle and working outward. Spread the mushroom mixture<br>over the 2 tenderloins. Starting with a long side, tightly roll up<br>each tenderloin. Secure the seams with the toothpicks.<br>Heat the same skillet over medium heat and add 2<br>Tbsp oil. Once oil is hot, place tenderloin in the skillet (toothpick-<br>side-down) and sear about 2 minutes per side (6-8 minutes<br>total).<br>Transfer the skillet with the tenderloin to the oven and<br>bake at 400˚F for 18-20 min or until an instant read thermometer<br>reads 145-150˚F in the thickest portion of the meat.  Transfer to a<br>cutting board, brush with the pan drippings and rest 10 minutes.<br>Mix the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil and 2<br>tablespoons parsley, the lemon zest, and salt and pepper to<br>taste in a bowl. Remove the toothpicks and slice the pork rolls.<br>Top with parsley oil.  Serve hot.
