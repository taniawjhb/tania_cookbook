Grilled Lemon & Chicken Skewers<br>800gms, skinless deboned chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat<br>1 teaspoon salt<br>2 Tbsp plain yogurt<br>2 cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)<br>1 Tbsp minced fresh oregano<br>1/2 teaspoons dried oregano<br>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br>1 teaspoon lemon juice<br>1 Tbsp olive oil plus more for the grill<br>2 lemons, thinly sliced<br>If using bamboo or wooden skewers, place them in water to soak while you prepare the recipe. You'll need either 4 flat skewers or 8<br>regular round skewers.<br>Cut the chicken thigh into even chunks, then place in a bowl and sprinkle with salt. Add the yogurt, minced garlic, oregano, pepper, lemon<br>juice, and olive oil to the bowl with the chicken, stir to combine. Marinate for 30 minutes to an hour - the longer the better.<br>Thread skewers with chicken and lemon slices: Prepare your grill for direct high heat. While the grill is heating, prepare the skewers. Use<br>either flat bamboo or metal skewers or double up regular bamboo skewers so that the chicken is easier to turn on the grill. Thread the<br>chicken pieces onto the skewers with a lemon slice folded over like a taco between each piece of chicken.<br>When the grill is ready brush the grill grates with a little olive oil (use a paper towel folded over several times and dipped in olive oil, hold<br>with tongs). Brush some olive oil over the chicken skewers as well. Place the chicken skewers directly over the hottest part of the grill and<br>cover the grill.<br>Allow to sear on one side (about 2 to 3 minutes), then turn the chicken skewers over to the other side, cover and cook 2 to 3 minutes more,<br>until the chicken is browned and just cooked through.<br>Remove from grill and serve immediately with tzatziki sauce.<br>The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.
