Grilled Lemon & Chicken Skewers
800gms, skinless deboned chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat
1 teaspoon salt
2 Tbsp plain yogurt
2 cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)
1 Tbsp minced fresh oregano
1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 Tbsp olive oil plus more for the grill
2 lemons, thinly sliced
If using bamboo or wooden skewers, place them in water to soak while you prepare the recipe. You'll need either 4 flat skewers or 8
regular round skewers.
Cut the chicken thigh into even chunks, then place in a bowl and sprinkle with salt. Add the yogurt, minced garlic, oregano, pepper, lemon
juice, and olive oil to the bowl with the chicken, stir to combine. Marinate for 30 minutes to an hour - the longer the better.
Thread skewers with chicken and lemon slices: Prepare your grill for direct high heat. While the grill is heating, prepare the skewers. Use
either flat bamboo or metal skewers or double up regular bamboo skewers so that the chicken is easier to turn on the grill. Thread the
chicken pieces onto the skewers with a lemon slice folded over like a taco between each piece of chicken.
When the grill is ready brush the grill grates with a little olive oil (use a paper towel folded over several times and dipped in olive oil, hold
with tongs). Brush some olive oil over the chicken skewers as well. Place the chicken skewers directly over the hottest part of the grill and
cover the grill.
Allow to sear on one side (about 2 to 3 minutes), then turn the chicken skewers over to the other side, cover and cook 2 to 3 minutes more,
until the chicken is browned and just cooked through.
Remove from grill and serve immediately with tzatziki sauce.
