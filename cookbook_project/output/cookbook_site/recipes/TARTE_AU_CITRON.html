TARTE AU CITRON
Pâte Sucrée
220 g flour , plain/all purpose
50 g soft icing sugar / powdered sugar , sifted
15 g almond meal / ground almonds
1/4 tsp salt
100g / 7 tbsp butter , unsalted, softened, cut
into 1cm cubes
1 large egg , at room temperature
Curd Filling
1 tbsp lemon zest (1 lemon's worth)
125 ml lemon juice (from 1 – 2 lemons)
150 g white sugar
170 g unsalted butter , cut in 1cm (1/2") cubes
3 whole eggs large,
3 egg yolks (from large-size eggs,
Method:  Pâte Sucrée
Step 1:  Place all the dry ingredients in the bowl of a food
processor.
Step 2:  Add the cold butter and pulse until the butter is
incorporated. Now add the whole egg and run the machine
until the dough starts to come together.
Step 3:  Gather the dough and wrap in clingwrap, shape into
a 2cm thick disc, place in the freezer for 10 minutes
Step 4:  Remove the pastry from the freezer and on a lightly
floured surface roll out until 3mm thick.
Step 5:  Transfer the pastry to your baking tin and gently ease
it into the sides, do not stretch the pastry as this will cause
shrinking. Dock the pastry thoroughly to avoid the pastry from
rising. Place the pastry shell oin the freezer for 10 minutes.
Step 6:  Remove from the freezer add a sheet of baking
paper and fill with baking beans place in the preheated oven
to 200°C / 390°F (180°C fan). Bake for 15 minutes then
remove the beans and baking paper and bake for a further
10-minutes until the base is lightly golden. Remove from the
oven and allow to cool completely before filling, this will keep
the crust nice and crisp.
LEMON TART FILLING:
Preheat oven: Preheat oven to 180℃
Step 1:  Whisk ingredients together: Put all ingredients in a medium saucepan and whisk to combine.
Step 2:  Thicken on stove: Place the saucepan on the stove over low / medium low heat. Whisk constantly,
especially as the butter is melting, to ensure it doesn't split. Keeping stirring until the mixture thickens enough to
visibly mound (ie. holds its shape briefly) on the surface when dolloped – about 5 minutes, though it might take
longer depending on stove strength, saucepan heat retention etc.
Strain into a bowl using a fine mesh strainer.
Fill tart: Pour into tart shell and smooth the filling surface using an offset spatula or similar.
Bake: Bake for 5 minutes. It will still be a soft custard when you touch it but not liquidity. It will set more when
cooled so it's sliceable.
Allow to cool completely before cutting as this will allow the tart to firm up.
