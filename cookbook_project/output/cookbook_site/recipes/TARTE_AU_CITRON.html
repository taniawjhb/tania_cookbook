Now add the whole egg and run the machine<br>until the dough starts to come together.<br>Step 3:  Gather the dough and wrap in clingwrap, shape into<br>a 2cm thick disc, place in the freezer for 10 minutes<br>Step 4:  Remove the pastry from the freezer and on a lightly<br>floured surface roll out until 3mm thick.<br>Step 5:  Transfer the pastry to your baking tin and gently ease<br>it into the sides, do not stretch the pastry as this will cause<br>shrinking. Dock the pastry thoroughly to avoid the pastry from<br>rising. Place the pastry shell oin the freezer for 10 minutes.<br>Step 6:  Remove from the freezer add a sheet of baking<br>paper and fill with baking beans place in the preheated oven<br>to 200°C / 390°F (180°C fan). Bake for 15 minutes then<br>remove the beans and baking paper and bake for a further<br>10-minutes until the base is lightly golden. Remove from the<br>oven and allow to cool completely before filling, this will keep<br>the crust nice and crisp.<br>LEMON TART FILLING:<br>Preheat oven: Preheat oven to 180℃<br>Step 1:  Whisk ingredients together: Put all ingredients in a medium saucepan and whisk to combine.<br>Step 2:  Thicken on stove: Place the saucepan on the stove over low / medium low heat. Whisk constantly,<br>especially as the butter is melting, to ensure it doesn't split. Keeping stirring until the mixture thickens enough to<br>visibly mound (ie. holds its shape briefly) on the surface when dolloped – about 5 minutes, though it might take<br>longer depending on stove strength, saucepan heat retention etc.<br>Strain into a bowl using a fine mesh strainer.<br>Fill tart: Pour into tart shell and smooth the filling surface using an offset spatula or similar.<br>Bake: Bake for 5 minutes. It will still be a soft custard when you touch it but not liquidity. It will set more when<br>cooled so it's sliceable.<br>Allow to cool completely before cutting as this will allow the tart to firm up.
