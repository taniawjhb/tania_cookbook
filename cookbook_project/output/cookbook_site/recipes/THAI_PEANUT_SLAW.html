THAI PEANUT SLAW
In a medium bowl, whisk together all of the ingredients for the
dressing (be sure the peanut butter is dissolved). Set aside.
Combine all of the slaw ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Add
the dressing and and toss well. Let the slaw sit for at least ten
minutes so the vegetables have a chance to soak up the
dressing.
Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Serve cold. This slaw is
best served fresh but leftovers will keep in a covered container in
the refrigerator for a few days.
