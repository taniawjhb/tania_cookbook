INGREDIENTS
400g black beans, drained
2 large handfuls baby spinach leaves, 
roughly chopped
500g ripe tomatoes, chopped into large 
chunks
½ cucumber, halved lengthways, seeds 
scooped out and sliced on an angle
1 large red onion, halved and finely sliced
6-8 radishes, sliced
2 avocados, peeled and sliced
100g feta, crumbled
handful of herbs (reserved from the dressing)
For the dressing

small bunch basil
1 fat green chilli, deseeded and chopped
1 small garlic clove
100ml extra virgin olive oil 
2 limes, zested and juiced

INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Make the dressing by blending all of the ingredients 
in a food processor (or very finely chop them), saving a few 
herb leaves for the salad. You can make the dressing up to 24 
hrs before serving.
Step 2:  Scatter the beans and spinach over a large platter. 
Arrange the tomatoes, cucumber, mango, onion and radishes 
on top and gently toss together with your hands. Top the 
salad with the avocados, feta and herbs, and serve the 
dressing on the side.
