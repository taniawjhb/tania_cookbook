The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.<br>Beer Prawns<br>Most likely influenced by the Mozambican Portuguese community<br>Juice of 2 lemons<br>1.5kg prawns, cleaned and heads removed (optional, although I don’t suggest it)<br>4 tbsp butter<br>150ml olive oil<br>10 cloves garlic, crushed<br>3 Tbsp piri-piri sauce (or more if desired)<br>2  can beer<br>1 cup chopped parsley<br>Salt & pepper<br>1 Heat the butter and olive oil in a saucepan, add the garlic, peri-peri, salt and beer, and simmer for two minutes.<br>Remove from the heat and cool for 15 minutes.<br>2. Once cooled, pour marinade, lemon juice and half your chopped parsley over your cleaned prawns (When cleaning, try<br>avoid butterflying them. Cut a slice into the back of the prawn and begin the butterflying process, without fully opening the<br>prawn (this allows them to hold moisture better)<br>3. Set your prawns aside in the fridge for 30min – 1 hour<br>4. Heat butter and olive oil on medium-high heat in a pan. Remove your prawns from the marinade, removing as much<br>liquid as possible, and pan fry them 3-4 minutes a side, or until cooked through. Remove from pan and keep warm in a<br>dish. Once you have cooked all the prawns, pour remaining marinade back into pan and reduce, pour the thickened liquid<br>over your prawns.<br>5. Finish with some fresh chopped parsley
