Beer Prawns
Most likely influenced by the Mozambican Portuguese community
Juice of 2 lemons
1.5kg prawns, cleaned and heads removed (optional, although I don’t suggest it)
4 tbsp butter
150ml olive oil
10 cloves garlic, crushed
3 Tbsp piri-piri sauce (or more if desired)
2  can beer
1 cup chopped parsley
Salt & pepper
1 Heat the butter and olive oil in a saucepan, add the garlic, peri-peri, salt and beer, and simmer for two minutes.
Remove from the heat and cool for 15 minutes.
2. Once cooled, pour marinade, lemon juice and half your chopped parsley over your cleaned prawns (When cleaning, try
avoid butterflying them. Cut a slice into the back of the prawn and begin the butterflying process, without fully opening the
prawn (this allows them to hold moisture better)
3. Set your prawns aside in the fridge for 30min – 1 hour
4. Heat butter and olive oil on medium-high heat in a pan. Remove your prawns from the marinade, removing as much
liquid as possible, and pan fry them 3-4 minutes a side, or until cooked through. Remove from pan and keep warm in a
dish. Once you have cooked all the prawns, pour remaining marinade back into pan and reduce, pour the thickened liquid
over your prawns.
5. Finish with some fresh chopped parsley
