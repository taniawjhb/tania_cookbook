CHICKEN DUMPLINGS
150g chicken mince
1 tsp finely chopped lemongrass
½ tsp finely grated ginger
1 cup finely chopped cabbage
1 spring onion, chopped
Handful of fresh coriander leaves, chopped
1 tsp chicken stock powder
2 tsp cornflour
1 tsp sesame oil
1 Tbsp Sweet Chilli Sauce
25 dumpling wrappers
To make the Dumpling Filling: In a bowl, mix all the ingredients
together.
To make the dumplings: Wet the edge of a dumpling wrapper.
Place a teaspoonful of the filling in the middle of the wrapper.
Fold the wrapper in half to form a semi-circle. Pinch the sides of
the wrapper to seal the mixture. Crimp the seal with your fingers
to form pleats, or use a fork. Stand the dumpling, seam side up,
on a tray lined with baking paper. Repeat with the remaining
filling and wrappers, keeping the dumplings separate on the tray
to avoid them sticking together.
Line a bamboo or metal steamer with baking paper. Steam the
dumplings over boiling water for 10-12 minutes or until they are
tender and filling is cooked. Remove from the steamer and stand
for 1-2 minutes before serving them with the dipping sauce.
To make the dumplings crispy. Heat a little oil in a non-stick
frying pan. Place the steamed dumplings seam side up into the
pan and cook over a medium heat until the bases are golden
and crispy.
To make the Sweet Chilli Dipping Sauce: Whisk the ingredients
together.
