Pinch the sides of<br>the wrapper to seal the mixture. Crimp the seal with your fingers<br>to form pleats, or use a fork. Stand the dumpling, seam side up,<br>on a tray lined with baking paper. Repeat with the remaining<br>filling and wrappers, keeping the dumplings separate on the tray<br>to avoid them sticking together.<br>Line a bamboo or metal steamer with baking paper. Steam the<br>dumplings over boiling water for 10-12 minutes or until they are<br>tender and filling is cooked. Remove from the steamer and stand<br>for 1-2 minutes before serving them with the dipping sauce.<br>To make the dumplings crispy. Heat a little oil in a non-stick<br>frying pan. Place the steamed dumplings seam side up into the<br>pan and cook over a medium heat until the bases are golden<br>and crispy.<br>To make the Sweet Chilli Dipping Sauce: Whisk the ingredients<br>together.
