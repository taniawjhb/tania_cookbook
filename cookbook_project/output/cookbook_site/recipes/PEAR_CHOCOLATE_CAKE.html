4 large, very firm and hard pears
170 g of '00 flour
30 g of bitter cocoa powder
170 g of sugar
70 g sunflower seed oil or melted butter

at room temperature
130 g dark chocolate (in flakes or drops)
1 sachet of vanilla or 1 teaspoon of extract
1 sachet of baking powder

Step 1:  To start beat eggs, sugar and vanilla for 2 minutes in 
a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, until the mixture 
becomes frothy and light. Then with your machine running 
add the oil in a thin stream.
Step 2:  In a second bowl, sift the flour, baking powder and 
cocao and then set aside.  
Step 3:  Now add a third of the flour mixture to the egg 
mixture and stir until all the flour has been abosrbed, then 
add half of the yoghurt mixture and stir until combine.

balance of the yoghurt.  Finally add the chocolate pieces, 
reserving a few to use on top.
Step 5:  Now peal your pears and cut them into 3 mm thick 
slices, and set aside, it is important that the pears are firm.
Step 6:  Now add your cake butter into a greased and lined 
24cm, baking tin

in upright so that they create interest, some slices can be 
pushed all the way into the batter and others you can keep 
sticking out partially.
Step 8:  The trick is to creating a beautiful design of pear and 
chocolate cake is to not to push the pears below the surface

minutes. The time is indicative and may vary depending on 
the oven!
