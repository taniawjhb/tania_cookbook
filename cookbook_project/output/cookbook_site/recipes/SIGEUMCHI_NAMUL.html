SIGEUMCHI NAMUL
250 g English spinach or baby spinach
1 tsp fine sea salt , to add to the water
6 cups water to boil
Seasoning sauce
1 tsp green onion , finely chopped
1/2 tsp minced garlic
1/4 tsp fine sea salt or to taste
1 tsp toasted sesame seeds
1 Tbsp sesame oil
Trim the spinach roots and wash the spinach in cold water
thoroughly.
Boil the water in a pot/sauce pan for 5 to 7 mins. Add the salt (1
tsp). Once the water starts to boil, plunge the spinach into the pot
and leave it for 30 seconds.
Drain the boiled water away and run cold water on the spinach
for 1-2 minutes.
Squeeze the spinach to remove excess water.
Cut the spinach into 2-3 pieces with a knife. (If you are using
baby spinach, you can skip this step.)
Add the seasoning sauce and mix well with your hands.
Serve it on a plate and enjoy.
