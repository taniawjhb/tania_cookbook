Grate the zucchini on to the towel in the bowl, using the large blades of the grater.<br>Sprinkle with a generous amount of salt to help the zucchini release more moisture.  Mix and squeeze the mixture with your hands.  Wrap<br>in the towel and squeeze very tightly in your hands to release as much liquid as possible.  The less moisture the zucchini mixture has, the<br>crunchier your fritters will become!  Transfer from towel to a clean, dry bowl.<br>Finely chop the green part of the spring onions.  Finely chop the mint leaves, dill and basil and add them all to the bowl.  Add the lime<br>zest, cumin, chili flakes, crumbled feta and 2 eggs.  Mix until all of the <br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2> are completely combined.<br>Add the flour and mix just to combine. Do not overmix.<br>Place a nonstick pan over medium to high heat.  Add 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil.  Pick up spoonfuls of the mixture and carefully add<br>them to the hot oil. Do not crowd your pan.  Gently press down on the patties to spread them out a little.<br>Fry on both sides until nice and golden, just like pancakes!  When ready, transfer to a plate lined with paper towels so they can drain from<br>excess oil.  Repeat the same process until all of your mixture has turned in to crunchy fritters.<br>Top the fritters with a small teaspoon of crème fraiche and a salmon ribbon, serve garnished with some fresh dill<br>The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.
