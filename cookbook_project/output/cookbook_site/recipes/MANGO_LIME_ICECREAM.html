MANGO & LIME ICECREAM<br>3/4 cup thawed frozen mango pulp<br>1/3 cup sweetened condensed milk<br>Grated zest and juice of 1 lime<br>1/4 cup confectioners' sugar<br>1/4 teaspoon coconut extract<br>150ml unsweetened coconut cream, chilled<br>1 cup cold heavy cream<br>Whisk the mango pulp, condensed milk, lime zest and juice,<br>confectioners' sugar and coconut extract in a large bowl until<br>smooth; set aside.<br>Scoop the solids off the top of the can of coconut cream into a<br>separate large bowl. (Discard the liquid; if any liquid has risen to<br>the top, pour it off before scooping out the solids.) Break the solid<br>coconut cream into small chunks, then add the heavy cream<br>and beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks<br>form, 1 to 2 minutes. (There may be a few small chunks of<br>coconut cream.)<br>Fold about half of the whipped cream into the mango mixture<br>with a rubber spatula until combined, then fold in the remaining<br>whipped cream until no white streaks remain.<br>Spoon the mixture into a freezer-safe 9-by-5-inch loaf pan or<br>2-quart baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm<br>and scoopable, at least 6 hours or overnight. Let soften about 20<br>minutes at room temperature before scooping.
