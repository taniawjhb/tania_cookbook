Dissolve the yeast in water, mixing<br>with your fingers. Set aside for the yeast mixture to get frothy<br>for 5 minutes.<br>Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl.<br>Make a well in the middle and pour in 2 tbsp. olive oil and<br>the yeast mixture.<br>Pour in the remaining ½ warm water to the flour<br>mixture. Using your hands, draw in the flour from the sides<br>and work the mixture into a dough.<br>Knead for 3 -5 minutes, until you reach a soft,<br>smooth dough. The dough gets sticky as you knead, so pour<br>the remaining 1 tbsp. olive oil and stir in additional 2 tbsp.<br>flour to help shape into a soft dough.<br>Place the dough in large bowl and cover with a cling<br>film. Leave it in a warm place for 1 hour; it will be doubled in<br>size.<br>In the meantime, prepare your filling. Heat 15ml/<br>1tbsp. olive oil in a wide heavy pan and stir in the onions,<br>garlic and peppers. Sauté for 2-3 minutes over medium<br>heat, until they start to soften.<br>Stir in the tomatoes and sauté for another 2 minutes.<br>Pour in the lemon juice and season with salt and ground<br>black pepper. Turn the heat off.<br>Place the ground meat, spices, tomato paste and fresh herbs<br>in a bowl and combine with the cooked vegetables mix well.<br>The topping is ready.<br>Once the dough is risen, place the dough on a lightly<br>floured surface. Knead the dough for a minute then divide the<br>dough into two pieces and roll into two balls.<br>On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough balls into<br>2 oval shapes of 20 cm x 40 cm, with ½ cm (0.2”) thickness.<br>Line a large baking tray with baking paper and place the 2<br>oval flat bread dough on the tray.<br>Spread the filling evenly over the 2 flat breads,<br>leaving 2 cm at the edges as a border with no filling (it is<br>easier to spread the filling while the oval flat bread is in the<br>tray). Fold in the sides to act as border to keep the filling<br>intact. Squeeze the oval dough at each end to make it pointy.<br>Beat an egg in a small bowl and mix it with 1 tbsp.<br>olive oil. Brush the edges of dough with this mixture.<br>Bake for 25 - 30 minutes, until the pides are golden brown<br>and crispy at the edges.<br>Once cool, cut into slices and serve.
