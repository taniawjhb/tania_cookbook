PIDE
For the dough:
300 gr + 2 tbsp. all-purpose plain flour
1 tsp. salt
14 gr dried yeast
1 pinch of sugar
1 cup warm water 
3 tbsp. olive oil
For the topping:
1 medium onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic
400 gr/14 oz. ground beef or ground lamb
or mixture
½ red/yellow bell pepper or 1 green pointy
pepper, finely diced
2 medium tomatoes, deseeded and diced
1 tbsp. lemon juice
1 tbsp. olive oil
1/2 tsp ground cumin 
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp ground all spice 
1/2 tsp chili powder
1 tbsp tomato paste
Small bunch flat leaf parsley
Salt (1 tsp. salt is recommended) and freshly
ground black pepper to taste
Pinch chili powder
1 egg + 15 ml/ 1 tbsp. olive oil to brush the
pide
Preheat the oven to 180 C/ 350 F
Stir in the dried yeast and sugar in a small bowl and
pour in ½ cup warm water. Dissolve the yeast in water, mixing
with your fingers. Set aside for the yeast mixture to get frothy
for 5 minutes.
Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl.
Make a well in the middle and pour in 2 tbsp. olive oil and
the yeast mixture.
Pour in the remaining ½ warm water to the flour
mixture. Using your hands, draw in the flour from the sides
and work the mixture into a dough.
Knead for 3 -5 minutes, until you reach a soft,
smooth dough. The dough gets sticky as you knead, so pour
the remaining 1 tbsp. olive oil and stir in additional 2 tbsp.
flour to help shape into a soft dough.
Place the dough in large bowl and cover with a cling
film. Leave it in a warm place for 1 hour; it will be doubled in
size.
In the meantime, prepare your filling. Heat 15ml/
1tbsp. olive oil in a wide heavy pan and stir in the onions,
garlic and peppers. Sauté for 2-3 minutes over medium
heat, until they start to soften.
Stir in the tomatoes and sauté for another 2 minutes.
Pour in the lemon juice and season with salt and ground
black pepper. Turn the heat off.
Place the ground meat, spices, tomato paste and fresh herbs
in a bowl and combine with the cooked vegetables mix well.
The topping is ready.
Once the dough is risen, place the dough on a lightly
floured surface. Knead the dough for a minute then divide the
dough into two pieces and roll into two balls.
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough balls into
2 oval shapes of 20 cm x 40 cm, with ½ cm (0.2”) thickness.
Line a large baking tray with baking paper and place the 2
oval flat bread dough on the tray.
Spread the filling evenly over the 2 flat breads,
leaving 2 cm at the edges as a border with no filling (it is
easier to spread the filling while the oval flat bread is in the
tray). Fold in the sides to act as border to keep the filling
intact. Squeeze the oval dough at each end to make it pointy.
Beat an egg in a small bowl and mix it with 1 tbsp.
olive oil. Brush the edges of dough with this mixture.
Bake for 25 - 30 minutes, until the pides are golden brown
and crispy at the edges.
Once cool, cut into slices and serve.
