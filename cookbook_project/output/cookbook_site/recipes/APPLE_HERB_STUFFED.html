<h2>Ingredients</h2><br>2 tablespoons olive oil<br>1 medium apple, peeled and cut into small <br>dice (about 1 cup)<br>1/4 medium yellow onion, finely chopped <br>(about 1/3 cup)<br>1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary<br>1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme<br>1 to 2 thick slices bread (enough to make <br>1/2 cup coarse breadcrumbs)<br>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard<br>1/8 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste<br>1/8 teaspoon pepper, plus more to taste<br>1 pork fillet (650gms)<br>8 to 10 strips bacon (about 360gms), cut in <br>half<br>INSTRUCTIONS<br>Step 1:  Heat the oven to 220C.  In a pan over medium heat, <br>heat the oil. Add the apple, onion, rosemary, and thyme, and <br>cook for 7 to 9 minutes, or until softened. Meanwhile, pulse <br>the bread slices in a food processor until you make coarse <br>crumbs. You should have about 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs.<br>Step 2:  Remove the pan with the onions and apples from the <br>heat, and stir in the breadcrumbs, mustard, salt, and pepper. <br>Set aside to cool briefly.<br>Step 3:  Cut a deep lengthwise slit down the center of the <br>tenderloin, stopping about 1.5cm from the bottom of the roast. <br>Open it up like a book. Cover with a piece of plastic wrap, and <br>with a mallet or rolling pin, gently pound it until it is of an even <br>thickness.<br>Step 4:  Spread the stuffing in a line along the center of the <br>meat. Bring the edges of the meat together to return it to its <br>original shape. Secure with toothpicks.<br>Step 5:  Lay out the bacon slices on a cutting board, <br>overlapping them slightly. Place the tenderloin on top with the <br>toothpicks facing up. Removing the toothpicks as you work, <br>wrap the bacon slices around the pork to form a log. Place <br>the tenderloin, bacon seam side down, on the baking sheet.<br>Step 6:  Roast for 20 to 25 minutes. If the roast is ready before <br>the bacon browns, place the tenderloin under the broiler for 3 <br>to 5 minutes to brown the bacon.<br>Step 7:  Let the tenderloin rest for 10 minutes before cutting <br>into slices:<br>Step 8:  Serve with the pan juices spooned over top if desired.<br>APPLE & HERB STUFFED <br>BACON WRAPPED PORK <br>FILLET
