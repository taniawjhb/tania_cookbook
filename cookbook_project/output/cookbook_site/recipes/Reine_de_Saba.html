Reine de Saba<br>12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) butter, more for pan<br>180gms bittersweet chocolate, chopped into small pieces<br>A few drops almond extract<br>2 tablespoons strong coffee<br>4 large eggs, separated<br>Pinch of salt<br>1 cup sugar<br>1 ¾ cups finely ground almonds<br>FOR THE GLAZE:<br>2 tablespoons sugar<br>1 tablespoon honey<br>120gms bittersweet chocolate, chopped into small pieces<br>1 tablespoon butter<br>Heat oven to 165C. Butter a 24cm springform pan, and line the side wall with parchment paper.<br>In a heavy-bottomed pan, combine 12 tablespoons butter, the chopped chocolate, almond extract and<br>coffee. Melt over low heat, then transfer to a bowl and allow to cool.<br>With an electric mixer, whisk egg whites and salt until soft peaks form. Slowly add 1/2 cup sugar until thick and<br>glossy. Set aside.<br>In a separate bowl, whisk together egg yolks with remaining 1/2 cup sugar until thick. Fold in the melted<br>chocolate mixture. Add ground almonds and mix well. Whisk in a dollop of egg whites to lighten mixture. Using<br>a rubber spatula, gently fold in the rest of egg whites, keeping batter airy.<br>Scrape batter into pan and bake until cake is dry on top and a bit gooey in center, 30 to 40 minutes. (After 30<br>minutes of baking, check center of cake with a tester or toothpick. If center seems very wet, continue baking.) Cool<br>cake on a rack for 20 minutes, then remove side of pan. Allow to continue cooling. Top of cake may crack as it<br>cools, but glaze will cover most cracking.<br>In a small saucepan, combine 2 tablespoons sugar, the honey and 1/4 cup water. Bring to a boil, then<br>remove from heat. Add 4 ounces chopped chocolate, swirl pan to mix, and allow to stand until melted, about 3<br>minutes.<br>Whisk 1 tablespoon butter into icing, then pour evenly over cake. Use a spatula to ease icing out to edges of<br>cake. Allow icing to cool, and set before slicing.<br>The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.
