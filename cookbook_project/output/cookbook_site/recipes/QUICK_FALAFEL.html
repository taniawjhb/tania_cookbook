QUICK FALAFEL<br>1 can chickpeas (rinsed, drained and patted<br>dry)<br>1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley<br>4 cloves garlic, minced<br>2 medium shallots (minced)<br>2 Tbsp raw sesame seeds<br>1 1/2 tsp cumin (plus more to taste)<br>1/4 tsp each sea salt and black pepper (plus<br>more to taste)<br>1 healthy pinch coriander (optional)<br>3-4 Tbsp all-purpose flour<br>3-4 Tbsp oil for cooking<br>Bread crumbs for coating<br>Add chickpeas, parsley, shallot, garlic, sesame seeds, cumin,<br>salt, pepper (and coriander and cardamom if using) to a food<br>processor or blender and mix/pulse to combine, scraping down<br>sides as needed until thoroughly combined. You’re looking for a<br>crumbly dough, not a paste.<br>Add flour 1 Tbsp at a time and<br>to combine until no longer<br>wet and you can mold the dough into a ball without it sticking to<br>your hands - about 4 Tbsp<br>Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added a bit more salt,<br>pepper, and a dash of coriander. You want the flavor to be pretty<br>bold, so don’t be shy.<br>Transfer to a mixing bowl, cover and refrigerate for 1-2 hours to<br>firm up. If you’re in a hurry you can chill in the freezer for 45<br>minutes or skip this step - but they will be a little more fragile<br>when cooking.<br>Once chilled, scoop out rounded Tablespoon amounts (~30 g in<br>weight // I used this scoop) and gently form into 11-12 small<br>discs (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering<br>batch size).<br>OPTIONAL: Sprinkle on panko bread crumbs and gently press to<br>adhere - flip and repeat. This will produce a crispier falafel, but<br>it's optional.<br>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add enough oil to<br>generously coat the pan - about 2 Tbsp (30 ml). Swirl to coat.<br>Once the oil is hot, add only as many falafel as will fit very<br>comfortably in the pan at a time - about 5-7 .<br>Cook for a total of 4-5 minutes, flipping when the underside is<br>deep golden brown. Repeat until all falafel are browned - the<br>deeper golden brown they are, the crispier they'll be. They will<br>also firm up more once slightly cooled.
