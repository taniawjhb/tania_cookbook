SPICED SALT & PEPPER SQUID<br>1 1/2 pounds squid<br>(680g)<br>1 tablespoon shaoxing wine<br>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil<br>5 cups vegetable oil (for frying; plus 1<br>tablespoon)<br>1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br>1/2 cup semolina flour<br>1/3 cup plain cornmeal<br>1 teaspoon salt (plus more to taste)<br>1/2 teaspoon white pepper (plus more to<br>taste)<br>2 long hot green peppers (cut lengthwise and<br>sliced thinly)<br>5 cloves garlic (sliced)<br>2 teaspoons ginger (minced)<br>First prepare your squid. Rinse it well in cold water. Cut the squid<br>into equal sizes, having each piece be roughly the same size is<br>important for achieving the same cooking time for each piece of<br>calamari. Drain the squid pieces in a colander and transfer to a<br>bowl.<br>Marinate the squid in the shaoxing wine and sesame oil. Toss<br>gently and set aside.<br>In a medium deep pot, add enough oil so that the level of oil<br>reaches 4 inches up the side of the pot. Heat the oil until the<br>temperature reaches 325 degrees.<br>While you're waiting for the oil to heat, prepare your dry mixture.<br>Combine the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, cornmeal, salt,<br>and white pepper in a medium bowl. Set aside.<br>When the oil reaches temperature, you're ready to start dredging<br>your squid. Work in batches of small fistfuls of calamari. Gently<br>squeeze off any liquid and dredge the squid in the dry mixture.<br>Using a long-handled sieve or slotted spoon, lower the calamari<br>into the hot oil. Gently move the calamari pieces back and forth.<br>Let them fry until golden brown, about 2-2 1/2 minutes. Remove<br>all the calamari and let drain on a paper-towel-lined plate. Taste<br>one piece of calamari for saltiness (be careful, it's hot). You can<br>sprinkle more salt immediately after frying to your taste. A<br>necessary step, however, is to crack some fresh white pepper<br>over the freshly fried squid.<br>Continue frying in these small batches and seasoning with white<br>pepper until you've fried all the squid.<br>Now the next phase: stir-frying the fried squid. Heat a wok over<br>medium-high heat. Add a tablespoon of vegetable oil. Add the<br>ginger and let it fry in the oil. After about 20 seconds, add the<br>garlic. Stir the garlic around the wok quickly in order to prevent<br>burning. When the garlic gets lightly golden in color, add the<br>peppers. Continue to stir fry for another 30 seconds.<br>Add the squid to the wok and stir fry quickly in the aromatic<br>mixture for about a minute or so. Plate and serve immediately<br>with white rice! And don't leave those crispy pieces of garlic and<br>pepper behind!
