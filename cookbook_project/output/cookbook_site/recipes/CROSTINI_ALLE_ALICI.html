<pre>
1 baguette
2 large fresh mozzarella balls
4 desalted and boned anchovies
50 gr butter
salt
Pepper
Slice the baguette into finger thick slices. Brush lightly with olive
oil, then in a non-stick pan over medium high heat, toast lightly.
Top each slice of crostini with a finger thick slice of mozarella
and place on a baking sheet. Bake in 200C oven until the
cheese begins to melt and the crostini has depened in colour.
While the crostini are toasting, melt the butter with the anchovies
in a small pan. Do this gently until the anchovies have melted.
Remove the toasted crostini, arrange on a serving platter, and
then drizzle with the anchovy butter.
