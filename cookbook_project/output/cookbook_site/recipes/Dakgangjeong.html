Dakgangjeong<br>1 pound boneless skinless chicken thigh and/or breast<br>1/2 cup milk optional<br>1/4 teaspoon salt<br>pinch pepper<br>1/2 teaspoon minced garlic<br>1/2 teaspoon minced ginger<br>1 tablespoon rice wine if not using milk<br>1/3 cup potato starch or corn starch<br>oil for deep frying<br>1 tablespoon soy sauce<br>3 tablespoons rice wine or mirin<br>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar or rice wine vinegar<br>1 tablespoon gochujang Korean red chili pepper paste<br>3 tablespoons honey or corn or rice syrup<br>2 teaspoons sesame oil<br>2 tablespoons brown sugar<br>1 teaspoon minced garlic<br>1 teaspoon grated ginger<br>pinch pepper<br>1 to 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped peanuts or seeds<br>Soak the chicken pieces in milk for at least 2 hours in the fridge. This step is optional.<br>Drain thoroughly. Remove any visible fat. Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces. Mix with the salt, pepper, rice wine (if you<br>didn’t use milk) garlic, and ginger. Let it stand for 20 to 30 minutes.<br>In a pan, add all the sauce <br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2>, and stir well. Bring it to a boil. When it starts to bubble, reduce the heat to medium<br>low, and simmer until it thickens slightly, about 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the heat off.<br>Add the potato (or corn) starch to the chicken, and mix well to coat evenly.<br>Pour about 1 inch of oil in to a heavy bottom pan. When the oil is sufficiently hot (180°C or starts smoking), drop the chicken<br>pieces in one at a time. Fry them in two batches. Overcrowding will drop the oil temperature too quickly. Cook until light<br>golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove and set them on a wire rack or a paper towel-lined plate.<br>Reheat the oil to 180°C. Deep fry again until golden brown, about 30 to 40 seconds. You can do the second frying in one<br>batch.<br>Heat the sauce over medium low heat. Add the chicken and stir well until the chicken pieces are evenly coated.<br>The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.
