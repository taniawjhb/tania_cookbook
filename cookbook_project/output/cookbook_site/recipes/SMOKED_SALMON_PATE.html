SMOKED SALMON PATE
150g smoked salmon, trimmings are fine
200g tub cream cheese
1 tbsp crème fraîche
juice half a lemon
Pinch of finely zested lemon rind
small bunch dill, finely chopped
Small bunch chives, finely chopped
breadsticks or granary toast, to serve
If you aren’t using smoked salmon trimmings then chop the
salmon into small pieces.
Tip the soft cheese, crème fraîche and lemon juice into a food
processor, season generously with black pepper and blitz until
smooth.
Add the smoked salmon and pulse a few times if you want the
paté chunky or blitz some more if you want the paté smooth
and pink.
Stir the herbs and lemon zest into the paté and spoon into a
large or four smaller bowls and serve with warm toast as a
starter or with breadsticks as a dip.
