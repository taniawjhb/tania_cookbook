INGREDIENTS
2 hearts of romaine
4 green onions
1/2 bunch dill
1/2 bunch mint
1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
For the Dressing
Juice of 1 large lemon
Salt
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Prepare a large mixing bowl with ice water. Thinly 
slice the romaine lettuce, then add to the ice water for 5 
minutes to crisp while you prepare the dressing and 
remaining ingredients.
Step 2:  Trim and finely chop the green onions (both the white 
and green parts). Finely chop the dill and mint leaves, 
discarding the stem.
Step 3:  Make the dressing. In a medium mixing bowl, add 
the lemon juice, a large pinch of kosher salt, and the oregano 
and whisk to combine. Continue whisking as you drizzle in 
the extra virgin olive oil. Whisk until emulsified. Set aside for 
now.
Step 4:  Drain the salad from the ice water and dry very 
thoroughly. A salad spinner helps if you have one, or use 
paper towels. Add to a large serving bowl, along with the 
chopped herbs, and feta. Give everything a gentle toss.
Step 5:  Just before serving, give the dressing one more quick 
whisk and pour it all over the salad. Mix well (or use your 
hands to massage the salad and coat it well with the 
dressing). Serve immediately.
