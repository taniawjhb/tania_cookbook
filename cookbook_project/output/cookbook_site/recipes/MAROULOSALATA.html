<h2>Ingredients</h2><br>2 hearts of romaine<br>4 green onions<br>1/2 bunch dill<br>1/2 bunch mint<br>1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese<br>For the Dressing<br>Juice of 1 large lemon<br>Salt<br>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano<br>1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil<br>INSTRUCTIONS<br>Step 1:  Prepare a large mixing bowl with ice water. Thinly <br>slice the romaine lettuce, then add to the ice water for 5 <br>minutes to crisp while you prepare the dressing and <br>remaining ingredients.<br>Step 2:  Trim and finely chop the green onions (both the white <br>and green parts). Finely chop the dill and mint leaves, <br>discarding the stem.<br>Step 3:  Make the dressing. In a medium mixing bowl, add <br>the lemon juice, a large pinch of kosher salt, and the oregano <br>and whisk to combine. Continue whisking as you drizzle in <br>the extra virgin olive oil. Whisk until emulsified. Set aside for <br>now.<br>Step 4:  Drain the salad from the ice water and dry very <br>thoroughly. A salad spinner helps if you have one, or use <br>paper towels. Add to a large serving bowl, along with the <br>chopped herbs, and feta. Give everything a gentle toss.<br>Step 5:  Just before serving, give the dressing one more quick <br>whisk and pour it all over the salad. Mix well (or use your <br>hands to massage the salad and coat it well with the <br>dressing). Serve immediately.<br>MAROULOSALATA
