250 grams cauliflower<br>florets (gobi cleaned)<br>½ cup all-purpose flour<br>(maida, prefer organic or at least unbleached)<br>¼ cup cornstarch<br>(white corn flour or yellow corn flour)<br>½ to 1 teaspoon red chilli powder<br>or paste (less spicy variety) (optional)<br>¼ teaspoon black pepper crushed or ground<br>¼ teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)<br>½ cup water (more if needed)<br>Oil  for deep frying as needed<br>1½ tablespoons oil<br>1 tablespoon garlic finely chopped<br>½ tablespoon ginger finely chopped<br>1 green chili chopped (optional)<br>⅓ cup onions or spring onions finely chopped<br>¼ cup bell pepper<br>(capsicum chopped finely) (optional)<br>1 tablespoon soya sauce<br>2 to 3 tablespoon Red Chilli sauce<br>1 to 2 tablespoon tomato ketchup<br>(optional, use if using hot sauce)<br>½ teaspoon Red chili powder<br>½ tablespoon rice wine vinegar<br>1 teaspoon sugar (adjust to taste)<br>Salt as needed<br>3 to 4 tablespoons water<br>½ to ¾ teaspoon black pepper crushed or<br>ground<br>⅛ teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)<br>2 tablespoons spring onion greens chopped for<br>garnish<br>1. Clean 250 grams of gobi and cut the florets to medium size.<br>2. Add them to 3 cups of hot water and rest for 5 minutes.<br>3. Later drain the gobi completely to a colander or spread on a clean<br>cloth until no moisture remains on the gobi.<br>4. You can do this ahead and set aside. Any moisture in the gobi will<br>cook it to soft and not crisp.<br>5. Heat up the oil for deep frying on a medium heat.<br>6. Meanwhile make the batter by adding cornstarch, all-purpose flour,<br>red chilli powder, black pepper and salt to a mixing bowl.<br>7. Mix and add water little by little as needed and make a free flowing<br>lump free batter. The consistency has to be medium and not too thick<br>or very runny. Adjust salt as needed by tasting the batter.<br>8. Then add the gobi florets to the batter in batches, coat them well.<br>1. When the oil turns hot enough, check by dropping a small amount of<br>batter to the hot oil. The batter has to rise without browning. This is the<br>correct temperature.<br>2. Pick up each cauliflower floret with a spoon or fingers & gently drop<br>them one by one to the hot oil. The flame has to be medium initially<br>and should be increased slightly as more gobi is added. Reduce the<br>flame to medium and fry until the florets turn golden and crisp. Keep<br>stirring in between for even frying.<br>3. Drain them to a kitchen tissue or a steel colander. Repeat the same<br>steps of adding the rest of the cauliflower florets to the batter, coating<br>them well and then frying them in hot oil until crisp.<br>4. For extra crisp gobi manchurian, you can also refry the once fried<br>gobi again in oil.<br>1. Mix together red chili powder with little water to a paste and keep<br>aside. This step is optional and is used mainly for the red color.<br>2. Heat 1½ tablespoons oil in a wide pan.<br>3. When the oil turns hot, add garlic, ginger and green chilies. Saute for<br>a minute or two.<br>4. Then add spring onions & capsicum. Saute them on a high flame for<br>2 mins.<br>5. Add soya sauce, red chili sauce, tomato ketchup, red chili paste,<br>sugar and vinegar.<br>6. Mix and add water. Mix and cook stirring and add pepper.<br>7. Cook on a medium heat until the sauce thickens.<br>8. Turn off the stove and check the taste.<br>9. The sauce has to be slightly sour, sweet & hot. If needed you can<br>adjust the salt & add more sauces as well.<br>10. Allow the sauce to cool for 1 to 2 mins.<br>11. Add the fried cauliflower and stir gently to coat the gobi well with<br>the manchurian sauce.<br>12. Garnish gobi manchurian with spring onion greens.<br>13. Serve immediately as a appetizer or as a side with noodles or fried<br>rice<br>GOBI MANCHURIAN
