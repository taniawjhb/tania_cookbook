<h2>Ingredients</h2><br>⅓ cup sliced almonds<br>450gms green beans, trimmed and cut into <br>7cm long pieces<br>¼ cup water<br>½ teaspoon fine sea salt, divided<br>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br>1 tablespoon lemon juice (about ½ lemon)<br>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard<br>1 small-to-medium clove garlic<br>1/4tsp freshly ground black pepper<br>Pinch of red pepper flakes<br>¼ cup crumbled feta cheese, divided<br>3 to 4 large basil leaves, torn or chopped, <br>for garnish<br>Lemon zest from about ½ lemon, for garnish<br>INSTRUCTIONS<br>Step 1:  Start with a large skillet over medium heat. Add the <br>almonds and cook, stirring frequently (careful, they burn <br>quickly). After 3 minutes, reduce the heat to medium-low, and <br>continue stirring until they are fragrant and turning golden on <br>the edges, about 1 to 3 more minutes.

Immediately add the green <br>beans, water and ¼ teaspoon salt. Cover and cook, stirring <br>occasionally, until the beans are nearly tender, about 7 to 10 <br>minutes. Remove the lid, raise heat to medium-high, and cook <br>until the liquid evaporates, 2 to 5 minutes. Remove the skillet <br>from the heat and set aside.<br>Step 3:  Meanwhile, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, <br>mustard, garlic, black pepper, red pepper flakes and <br>remaining ¼ teaspoon salt. Set aside.<br>Step 4:  Once the green beans are done cooking, whisk the <br>olive oil mixture once more, then pour it into the skillet. Pour <br>the almonds back into the skillet, and add about half of the <br>feta, reserving the other half for garnish. Toss to combine, then <br>taste and add more lemon juice or black pepper if necessary.<br>Step 5:  Transfer the green beans to a serving bowl or platter. <br>Sprinkle the remaining feta and the torn basil leaves on top. <br>Lightly grate some lemon zest on top, and serve promptly.<br>GREEN BEAN ALMOND &<br>FETA SALAD
