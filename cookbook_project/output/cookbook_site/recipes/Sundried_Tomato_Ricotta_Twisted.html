Secret Sunday Brunch in partnership with Pierre Jourdan<br>#anytimebubbly<br>Sundried Tomato & Ricotta Twisted <br>Loaf<br>2 1/4 cups flour<br>1/2 tsp salt<br>3/4 cup lukewarm milk<br>1 tbsp sugar<br>15 g fresh yeast (1 envelope active dry yeast)<br>1/8 cup (30 g) melted butter<br>1 egg yolk<br>1/4 cup (70 g) softened butter<br>5 tbsp grated parmesan<br>120gms sundried tomato halves<br>200gms ricotta cheese<br>100gms grated white cheddar<br>In a medium bowl stir fresh yeast with sugar until it liquefies. Stir in the lukewarm milk and then add the egg yolk and<br>melted butter. In a large bowl whisk together the flour and salt.<br>Pour the milk mixture over the dry <br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2> and start kneading it until it pulls away from the edges of the bowl. Give the<br>dough the shape of a ball. Sprinkle oil onto a clean bowl, place the dough and cover with plastic wrap. Let it rest for about 1<br>hour at room temperature (warm space) until doubled in size.<br>While the dough rises, process together the butter, sundried tomatoes, parmesan & ricotta cheese. Set aside.<br>Preheat the oven to 400 F (200 C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. On a floured surface, using a rolling pin roll the<br>dough to a rectangle of about 18x12 inches. Spoon the filling over top (keep about 1 tbsp of the filling for the end),<br>spreading evenly, leaving a clean 1/2-inch border around the edges. Sprinkle the grated chedda cheese’.<br>Roll up the dough and using a sharp knife, cut the log in half lengthwise leaving one edge uncut for about 1/2 inch. Start<br>braiding the two pieces, trying to keep the open layers exposed so the cut ends remain on top (this is what makes this<br>bread effect).Pinch the ends together. Transfer it to the prepared baking sheet.<br>Brush the wreath with the left butter filling. Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown. For the last 10 minutes you can<br>reduce the oven temperature to 180 C (350 F).
