INGREDIENTS
2 cucumbers
100 ml vinegar
1 red chilli
2 shallots
1 tablespoon sugar
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Mix the vinegar with a tablespoon of sugar in a 
medium bowl, stirring until the sugar has mostly dissolved.
Step 2:  Wash the cucumbers and cut them into thin slices. 
You can do this with a mandoline or with a chef's knife.
Step 3:  Peel the shallots and cut them into thin rings. Remove 
the seeds from the red chilli, if desired, and cut into pieces.
Step 4:  Mix the cucumber, red chilli and shallot well with the 
vinegar, and season with salt.
Step 5:  This cucumber salad is best when the flavour has 
time to develop. Delicious as a side dish or as part of an 
indonesian meal. Enjoy your dinner!
