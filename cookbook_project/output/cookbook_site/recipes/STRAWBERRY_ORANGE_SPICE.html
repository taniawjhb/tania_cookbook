<pre>
1 pound strawberries, hulled and halved (or
quartered if very large)
3 oranges
1/4 tsp ground cardamom
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus more to
taste
2-1/2 tablespoons light brown sugar, packed
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh mint, plus
a sprig for garnish
Hull and half or quarter the strawberries into a serving bowl.
Cut a slice off the top and bottom of each orange so they sit flat
on a cutting board. Using a sharp knife, work your way around
the fruits to remove all the skin and pith. Cupping the orange in
one hand and working over the serving bowl, carefully cut the
segments out from between the membranes. (Be sure to cut only
until you reach the middle of the fruit!) Over a separate small
bowl, firmly squeeze the remaining membranes to release all
the orange juice.
Add the lemon juice and brown sugar to the freshly squeezed
orange juice and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Pour over the
strawberries and orange segments and gently toss to combine.
Sprinkle with fresh mint. Taste and add more lemon juice if
necessary (the syrup should have a perfect balance of tart and
sweet). Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to six hours.
Garnish with sprigs of fresh mint and serve chilled
