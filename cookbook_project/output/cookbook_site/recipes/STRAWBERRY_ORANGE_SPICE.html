1 pound strawberries, hulled and halved (or<br>quartered if very large)<br>3 oranges<br>1/4 tsp ground cardamom<br>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus more to<br>taste<br>2-1/2 tablespoons light brown sugar, packed<br>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh mint, plus<br>a sprig for garnish<br>Hull and half or quarter the strawberries into a serving bowl.<br>Cut a slice off the top and bottom of each orange so they sit flat<br>on a cutting board. Using a sharp knife, work your way around<br>the fruits to remove all the skin and pith. Cupping the orange in<br>one hand and working over the serving bowl, carefully cut the<br>segments out from between the membranes. (Be sure to cut only<br>until you reach the middle of the fruit!) Over a separate small<br>bowl, firmly squeeze the remaining membranes to release all<br>the orange juice.<br>Add the lemon juice and brown sugar to the freshly squeezed<br>orange juice and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Pour over the<br>strawberries and orange segments and gently toss to combine.<br>Sprinkle with fresh mint. Taste and add more lemon juice if<br>necessary (the syrup should have a perfect balance of tart and<br>sweet). Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to six hours.<br>Garnish with sprigs of fresh mint and serve chilled<br>STRAWBERRY ORANGE & SPICE<br>SALAD
