Now spread your almonds <br>out in a pan, and bake for 15 minutes until lightly golden and <br>fragrant.  Remove and set aside to cool.  Reduce the oven to <br>175C.<br>Step 2: While your nuts are roasting, melt your butter in a small <br>pan, once melted remove from the heat and add your orange <br>zest and allow to cool.<br>Step 3: In the bowl of a stand mixer, or in a large bowl add <br>your eggs and caster sugar.  Whip with the whisk attachment <br>for at least 10 minutes to make a light and airy mixture.
