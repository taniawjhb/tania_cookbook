For the sauce<br>2 tablespoons Extra virgin olive oil<br>1 large yellow onion, halved and thinly <br>sliced (half moons)<br>2 large garlic cloves, minced<br>2 cans whole peeled tomatoes<br>2 teaspoons dried oregano<br>Black pepper<br>2 pounds white fish filet, such as halibut <br>or cod<br>Kosher salt and black pepper<br>For The Fish:<br>Kosher salt<br>½ teaspoon dried oregano<br>1 teaspoon sweet paprika<br>½ teaspoon ground cumin<br>2 lemons, divided<br>¼ cup fresh parsley, chopped<br>Instructions<br>Step 1:  Heat the oven. Preheat the oven to 200C and position <br>a rack in the middle.<br>Step 2:  Make the sauce. In a large oven-safe pan or skillet, <br>heat 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil over medium-high <br>heat until shimmering. Add the sliced onions and season with <br>a big pinch of kosher salt. Cook, tossing regularly, until the <br>onions have softened and gained a slight golden-brown color <br>(about 7 minutes). Add the garlic toss briefly, then add the <br>canned tomatoes with their juices. Using a wooden spoon, <br>break the tomatoes up. Season with a dash more salt. Add <br>the oregano and a big dash of black pepper. Bring the sauce <br>to a boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer for 10 to 15 <br>minutes or so.<br>Step 3:  Season the fish. Pat the fish dry and season on both <br>sides with kosher salt, the oregano, paprika and cumin. Cut <br>and squeeze one lemon over the fish (leave the other lemon <br>for later).<br>Step 4:  Combine the sauce and the fish. When the sauce is <br>ready, nestle the fish in the sauce and scoop up some of the <br>sauce to cover the top of the fish well.<br>Step 5:  Bake. Place the fish on the center rack of the heated <br>oven and bake until the fist turns opaque white and flakes <br>easily at the touch of a fork (15 to 25 minutes, but because <br>ovens do vary, it is a good idea to check occasionally to make <br>sure the fish does not overcook or dry out).<br>Step 6:  Serve. Slice the remaining lemon into wedges. Finish <br>the fish with the fresh parsley and serve with the lemon <br>wedges to the side.<br>PSARI PLAKI
