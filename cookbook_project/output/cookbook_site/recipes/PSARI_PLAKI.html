<pre>
For the sauce
2 tablespoons Extra virgin olive oil
1 large yellow onion, halved and thinly 
sliced (half moons)
2 large garlic cloves, minced
2 cans whole peeled tomatoes
2 teaspoons dried oregano
Black pepper
2 pounds white fish filet, such as halibut 
or cod
Kosher salt and black pepper
For The Fish:
Kosher salt
½ teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon sweet paprika
½ teaspoon ground cumin
2 lemons, divided
¼ cup fresh parsley, chopped
Instructions
Step 1:  Heat the oven. Preheat the oven to 200C and position 
a rack in the middle.
Step 2:  Make the sauce. In a large oven-safe pan or skillet, 
heat 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil over medium-high 
heat until shimmering. Add the sliced onions and season with 
a big pinch of kosher salt. Cook, tossing regularly, until the 
onions have softened and gained a slight golden-brown color 
(about 7 minutes). Add the garlic toss briefly, then add the 
canned tomatoes with their juices. Using a wooden spoon, 
break the tomatoes up. Season with a dash more salt. Add 
the oregano and a big dash of black pepper. Bring the sauce 
to a boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer for 10 to 15 
minutes or so.
Step 3:  Season the fish. Pat the fish dry and season on both 
sides with kosher salt, the oregano, paprika and cumin. Cut 
and squeeze one lemon over the fish (leave the other lemon 
for later).
Step 4:  Combine the sauce and the fish. When the sauce is 
ready, nestle the fish in the sauce and scoop up some of the 
sauce to cover the top of the fish well.
Step 5:  Bake. Place the fish on the center rack of the heated 
oven and bake until the fist turns opaque white and flakes 
easily at the touch of a fork (15 to 25 minutes, but because 
ovens do vary, it is a good idea to check occasionally to make 
sure the fish does not overcook or dry out).
Step 6:  Serve. Slice the remaining lemon into wedges. Finish 
the fish with the fresh parsley and serve with the lemon 
wedges to the side.
