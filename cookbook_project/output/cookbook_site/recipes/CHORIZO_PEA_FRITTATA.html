CHORIZO & PEA FRITTATA<br>1 tsp oil<br>1 onion, roughly chopped<br>1 red pepper, seeds removed, chopped<br>200g chorizo, skin removed and roughly chopped<br>6 free-range eggs<br>50ml/2fl oz milk<br>1 garlic clove, finely chopped<br>200g cooked potatoes, roughly chopped<br>100g frozen peas<br>2 tbsp chopped flatleaf parsley<br>Preheat the oven to 200C.<br>Heat an ovenproof frying pan on the hob until just hot, then add the oil, onion and red pepper and fry for 2<br>minutes, until just softened. Turn the heat up, add the chorizo and cook for 3-4 minutes until it has released its oil<br>and is crisp around the edges. The mixture will go a lovely red colour.<br>Meanwhile, crack the eggs into a large jug and whisk with the milk, a pinch of salt and plenty of black pepper.<br>Add the garlic and potatoes to the chorizo mixture and fry for another 2 minutes, stirring gently, until just hot<br>through. Add the peas and cook for another minute, until the whole mixture is hot.<br>Pour in the egg, stir briefly, turn down to a medium heat and scatter the parsley over the top .Fry without stirring,<br>for 1–2 minutes, then carefully lift the edge of the frittata with a spatula to check if it is cooked and golden-brown<br>underneath. If it isn’t, cook for another minute then check again.<br>Place the pan in the oven and bake for 10–12 minutes. When the top is bubbled up and slightly golden use a<br>tea towel to grab the handle and give the pan a gentle shake. If the middle wobbles it needs a little longer. If it’s<br>fairly firm, put it aside to cool slightly.<br>Slide the frittata out of the pan onto a plate. You can serve this hot or cold but make sure to let it cool to room<br>temperature before storing it in a sealable container in the fridge. Cut it into slices and serve with a green salad.<br>Secret Sunday Brunch in partnership with Pierre Jourdan<br>#anytimebubbly
