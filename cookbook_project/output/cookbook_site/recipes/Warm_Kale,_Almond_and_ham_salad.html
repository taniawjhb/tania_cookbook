Warm Kale, Almond and ham salad
2 shallots, sliced into rounds 
2 tsp vegetable oil
200g kale, large stalks removed, leaves roughly torn 
4-6 slices serrano ham or your choice of cured ham 
3 celery stalks, thinly sliced on an angle
shavings of Manchego cheese, to garnish (optional)
2 tbsp sherry vinegar
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 
2 tsp Dijon mustard
pinch of sugar
2 tbsp raisins
2 tbsp whole blanched almonds 
½ tsp vegetable oil
good pinch of sweet smoked paprika
1.  Heat oven to 200C. Toss the shallots with 1 tsp oil on a large non-stick baking tray. Separate the 
rings a little as you turn them in the oil. Roast for 10 mins, stirring halfway, until starting to soften and 
turn golden here and there.
2.  In a large bowl, whisk the vinegar, oil, mustard, sugar and some seasoning together to make the 
dressing, then tip in the raisins and leave to soak. In a smaller roasting tin, toss the almonds, oil, papri- 
ka and a pinch of sea salt. Rub the kale all over with 1 tsp vegetable oil and some seasoning.
3.  Remove the shallot tray from the oven, mix in the kale (it’s fine if it mounds a bit), then return the tray 
to the oven and put the almonds on the shelf below. Roast for 7 mins, giving the kale a turn halfway 
through, until crisp in some places, wilted in others.
4.  Ruffle the ham onto serving plates. Tip the kale, shallots and celery into the dressing bowl, make 
sure it coats the kale well, then mound on top of the ham and scatter with the almonds and the 
cheese, if using.
