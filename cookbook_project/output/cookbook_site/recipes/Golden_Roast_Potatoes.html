The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.<br>Golden Roast Potatoes<br>1kg potatoes, peeled and cut into pieces <br>170g duck fat<br>½ tbs salt<br>2 tbs polenta<br>Preheat your oven to 240ºC<br>Place the duck fat in a roasting tray & place in the oven to start heating up. The secret to these potatoes is to get <br>the duck fat ferociously hot.<br>In a large pot, cover the potatoes with cold water, season well & bring to the boil. Parboil the potatoes for no more <br>than 10 minutes.  Drain the potatoes & return them to the pot<br>Place the polenta/semolina in the pot, cover tightly & give the potatoes a ferocious shake to coat them evenly & <br>smash up their edges a bit (these are the parts that really crisp up nicely)<br>Carefully remove the tray from the oven & using a pair of tongs, place the potatoes gently into the sizzling duck fat<br>Return the tray to the oven & roast the potatoes for 1 hour, turning them throughout the cooking time so that they <br>brown on all sides<br>Remove from the trays, drain on some kitchen towel & serve immediately. Golden, crusty, crunchy perfection
