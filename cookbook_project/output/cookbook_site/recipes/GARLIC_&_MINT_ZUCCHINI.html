<pre>
2 courgettes (zucchinis)
2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 garlic clove, (peeled but not sliced)
1 handful fresh mint
juice of ¼ lemon
salt and pepper, to taste
Instructions
Step 1: First, cut the zucchini into 3cm x .5cm batons.
[Optional pre-salting the zucchini - Place the zucchini batons 
in a colander set over a bowl and liberally sprinkle salt over 
them. Quickly mix the salt into the courgettes with your hands 
and leave for 5-10 minutes so that the salt can draw out the 
juices from the courgette. Once the batons look wet and 
glistening, rinse them under the tap in the colander to wash 
away all the salt and any juices. Then dry in a clean tea towel 
or kitchen towel.]
Step 2:  In the meantime, slice the fresh mint thinly. 
Step 3:  Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. 
Once hot, add the whole garlic clove and move around in the 
pan to brown on all sides and flavour the oil. Once browned, 
remove from the pan and discard (or use to flavour in 
something else).
Step 4:  Add the courgette batons in one single layer. Do not 
overlap the batons. You may need to sauté the courgette 
batons in batches. Sauté the courgette batons until the 
underside is golden brown (about 2-4 minutes), then, using a 
pair of kitchen tongs, turn each slice over to cook on all the 
other side. Cook until golden brown on all sides.
Step 5:  Once cooked, add the chopped mint and a squeeze 
of lemon juice and stir over the heat for 30 seconds until the 
mint has wilted and the lemon juice is mixed into the 
courgette batons. (If cooking in batches, add the pre-cooked 
slices back into the pan at this point and stir all together over 
the heat). Season with salt and pepper to your taste.  Serve 
hot.
