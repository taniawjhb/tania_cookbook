4 medium cloves garlic, smashed and peeled<br>2 bay leaves<br>1 tablespoon ground cumin<br>1 ¾ teaspoons fine sea salt, divided<br>Freshly ground black pepper<br>5 cups water<br>1 cup brown* basmati rice, rinsed and<br>drained<br>1 cup regular brown or green lentils**, picked<br>over for debris, rinsed and drained<br>⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil<br>2 medium-to-large yellow onions, halved and<br>thinly sliced<br>½ cup thinly sliced green onions (from 1<br>bunch), divided<br>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro or flat-leaf<br>parsley, divided<br>Plain whole-milk or Greek yogurt, for serving<br>Spicy sauce, for serving (optional): shatta or<br>zhoug or store-bought chili-garlic sauce or<br>even sriracha<br>MUJADARA<br>In a large Dutch oven or soup pot, combine the garlic, bay leaves,<br>cumin, 1 ½ teaspoons of the salt and about 20 twists of freshly ground<br>black pepper. Add 5 cups water and bring the mixture to a boil over<br>medium-high heat.<br>Once boiling, stir in the rice and reduce the heat to medium. Cover and<br>cook, stirring occasionally and adjusting the heat as necessary to<br>maintain a controlled simmer, for 10 minutes.<br>Stir in the lentils and let the mixture return to a simmer. Cover again,<br>reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook until the liquid is absorbed<br>and the rice and lentils are tender, about 20 to 23 minutes.<br>Meanwhile, warm the olive oil in a large (12-inch) skillet over medium-<br>high heat. When it’s warm enough that a slice of onion sizzles on<br>contact, add the remaining onions. Stir to combine.<br>Stir only every 3 minutes or so at first, then more often once the onions<br>at the edges of the pan start browning. If the onions are browning<br>before they have softened, dial down the heat to give them more time.<br>Cook until the onions are deeply caramelized and starting to crisp at<br>the edges, about 20 to 30 minutes. In the meantime, line a large plate<br>or cutting board with a couple paper towels.<br>Using a slotted spoon or fish spatula, transfer the onions to the lined<br>plate and spread them evenly across. Sprinkle the remaining<br>teaspoon salt over the onions. They’ll crisp up as they cool.<br>When the lentils and rice are done cooking, drain off any excess water<br>(if there is any) and return the mixture to the pot, off the heat. Lay a<br>kitchen towel across the top of the pot to absorb steam, then cover the<br>pot and let it rest for 10 minutes.<br>Remove the lid, discard the bay leaves, and smash the garlic cloves<br>against the side of the pan with a fork. Add about ¾ of the green<br>onions and cilantro, reserving the rest for garnish. Gently stir and fluff<br>the rice with a fork. Season to taste with additional salt and pepper, if<br>necessary.<br>Transfer the rice and lentil mixture to a large serving platter or bowl. Top<br>with the caramelized onions and the remaining green onions and<br>cilantro. Serve hot, warm or at room temperature, with yogurt and spicy<br>sauce (optional) on the side.
