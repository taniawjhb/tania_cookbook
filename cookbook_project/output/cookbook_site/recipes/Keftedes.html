Keftedes
500g ground beef
200g ground pork
1 large red onion, grated
1 clove of garlic, minced
1 cup breadcrumbs
1 egg
1/4 of a cup chopped fresh parsley
6-7 leaves fresh mint (chopped)
2 tbsps olive oil
1/2 teaspoon oregano
salt and pepper
oil for frying
flour for dredging
To prepare this traditional Greek meatballs recipe (keftedes), add all the ingredients into a large bowl and mix
well (for about 5-10 minutes), squeezing with your hands, to allow the flavours to blend. (If the mixture isn’t firm
enough, add some more breadcrumbs). Cover the bowl with some plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for 1
hour.
Turn the mixture for the keftedes out of the fridge and roll into meatballs the size of a walnut (or bigger if you
prefer). Dredge the rolled meatballs lightly in flour making sure to shake off any excess. Fry until nicely browned
on all sides.
The traditional way of cooking Greek meatballs (keftedes) is frying them. Fry the keftedes in batches of 10-15 at a
time, until nicely browned on all sides.
Instead of frying you can bake / grill the keftedes in the oven. Preheat the oven at 200C, place the keftedes on
greased baking sheet about an inch apart. Bake for about 20 minutes, turning the meatballs upside down
midway through cooking time. The grilled version is much lighter than the fried so theres not excuse to not trying
it now!
