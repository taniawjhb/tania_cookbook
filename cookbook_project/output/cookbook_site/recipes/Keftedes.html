The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.<br>Keftedes<br>500g ground beef<br>200g ground pork<br>1 large red onion, grated<br>1 clove of garlic, minced<br>1 cup breadcrumbs<br>1 egg<br>1/4 of a cup chopped fresh parsley<br>6-7 leaves fresh mint (chopped)<br>2 tbsps olive oil<br>1/2 teaspoon oregano<br>salt and pepper<br>oil for frying<br>flour for dredging<br>To prepare this traditional Greek meatballs recipe (keftedes), add all the <br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2> into a large bowl and mix<br>well (for about 5-10 minutes), squeezing with your hands, to allow the flavours to blend. (If the mixture isn’t firm<br>enough, add some more breadcrumbs). Cover the bowl with some plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for 1<br>hour.<br>Turn the mixture for the keftedes out of the fridge and roll into meatballs the size of a walnut (or bigger if you<br>prefer). Dredge the rolled meatballs lightly in flour making sure to shake off any excess. Fry until nicely browned<br>on all sides.<br>The traditional way of cooking Greek meatballs (keftedes) is frying them. Fry the keftedes in batches of 10-15 at a<br>time, until nicely browned on all sides.<br>Instead of frying you can bake / grill the keftedes in the oven. Preheat the oven at 200C, place the keftedes on<br>greased baking sheet about an inch apart. Bake for about 20 minutes, turning the meatballs upside down<br>midway through cooking time. The grilled version is much lighter than the fried so theres not excuse to not trying<br>it now!
