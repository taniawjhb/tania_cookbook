The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.<br>Fried Rice with Shrimp<br>1.5 cups of cooked Jasmine rice cooled (or day old rice works well too) - Or just estimate about 1 normal bowl full<br>About 5 - 10 prawns, head peeled, but tail on<br>¼ of a big white onion (or ½ of a very small white onion))<br>1 cup fresh pineapple cut into 1cm cubes<br>½ head brocolli, broken into small florets<br>2 cloves garlic<br>2 eggs<br>½ tablespoon soy sauce<br>½ tablespoon oyster sauce<br>Pinch of sugar (optional)<br>1 tablespoon of oil for frying<br>5 Thai chilies<br>3 tablespoons of fish sauce<br>½ of a lime<br>If you’re using whole fresh shrimp, first pinch off the head, and peel the outer shell of the shrimp, leaving only the tail on (that’s Thai style).<br>Peel 2 cloves of garlic, and then just finely mince them, Slice ¼ of a sweet white onion into medium sized strips, finely dice about 3 - 4<br>green onions<br>Take your broccoli head, remove all thick stems, reserving small trimmed heads. Prepare your pineapple.<br>Turn on your stove to medium high, heat up your wok (or frying pan), and add about 1 tablespoon of oil<br>Once your oil is hot, add the garlic first, and stir fry continuously for about 15 seconds or so, until it gets nice and fragrant<br>Next, toss in your shrimp, and fry for about 30 seconds - your shrimp should start to turn pink and feel more firm. Now add the pineapple<br>Add in a little less than ½ of your rice first. This is going to soak up all those delicious shrimp juices and oils and keep your rice nice and<br>dry. Stir fry for about 10 more seconds - This is a little known trick to make good rice, so it remains nice and dry<br>Scoot all your rice to one side of the pan, and then crack in the eggs into the empty side. Whirl the egg up, let it cook for a few seconds,<br>and then start to mix it up with the rice and shrimp<br>Keep stir frying for about 20 seconds until the egg is fully cooked, and then add in the rest of your rice, and give it a quick stir<br>Add ½ tablespoon of soy sauce, ½ tablespoon of oyster sauce, just a pinch of sugar (optional), and continue stir frying your rice, making<br>sure all the sauce get mixed in<br>Then add your chopped Chinese broccoli and onions, and stir fry for another 30 seconds until the vegetables wilt, but they can still be<br>crisp and not fully cooked<br>Lastly, toss in your green onions, stir it a few more seconds, and it’s ready<br>Immediately dish your fried rice onto a plate<br>Slice off a wedge of lime, and serve it on the plate next to the rice<br>For the final touch, I like to sprinkle some freshly ground black pepper on top to give some extra flavor
