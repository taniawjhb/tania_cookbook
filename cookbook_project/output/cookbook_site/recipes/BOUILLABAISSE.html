<pre>
1 tablespoon hot fish stock or clam broth
2 cloves garlic, peeled
1 small red hot pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup soft white bread, pulled into bits
1/2 cup olive oil
Bouillabaisse:
1.2kg of at least 3 different kinds of fish fillets, 
cut into 2-inch pieces
450g mussels 
450g prawns
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 cup onions, thinly sliced
2 leeks, white and light green parts only, thinly 
sliced
1/4 fennel bulb, thinly sliced, or 1 teaspoon 
fennel seeds
2 cloves garlic, crushed
3 large tomatoes, roughly chopped
1 bay leaf
3 sprigs fresh thyme
1/2 teaspoon saffron threads
2 teaspoons salt
1 long, wide strip orange zest
1 cup clam juice or fish stock
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Sliced rustic French bread, plain or toasted
STEP 1
Make the sauce rouille:
Put the hot fish stock or clam broth into the bottom 
of a blender. Add the garlic and red hot pepper, 
salt and bread. Blend until very smooth. With the 
blender still running, add olive oil slowly and stop 
the blending as soon as the oil disappears. Set 
aside.
STEP 2:  Heat 1/4 cup of olive oil in a large pot on 
medium high heat. When the oil is hot, add the 
onions, leeks, and fennel. Stir to coat the 
vegetables with the olive oil. Cook on medium 
heat until softened but not browned, about 10 to 15 
minutes.
STEP 3:  Add the crushed garlic, chopped tomatoes, 
bay leaf, thyme, saffron, salt, and orange zest.  
Cook until the tomatoes are soft and broken down, 
about 10 more minutes.
STEP 4:  Bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Lay the fish 
pieces over the vegetable mixture and pour over 
with 2 cups of boiling water. Add clam juice or fish 
stock. Bring everything to a boil, reduce to a 
simmer, and cook, uncovered, for about 5 minutes.
STEP 5:  Add the mussels, squid, and prawns, 
pushing aside the fish so that the shellfish is now 
covered in liquid, and simmer for 10 minutes more, 
uncovered.
STEP 6:  Add freshly ground black pepper, and 
more salt to taste. Remove the bay leaves, thyme 
sprigs, and orange zest from the broth.
Serve with bread and rouille:
