The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.<br>Crepes Suzette<br>100g plain flour<br>1 tbsp golden caster sugar<br>2 large eggs<br>1 tbsp sunflower oil<br>300ml semi-skimmed milk<br>splash of beer, about 2 tbsp (optional)<br>To make the sauce for crepes suzette<br>100g butter<br>100g golden caster sugar<br>150ml freshly squeezed orange juice (about 12 large oranges)<br>2 tsp finely grated orange zest<br>1 tsp finely grated lemon zest<br>3 tbsp Grand Marnier<br>2 tbsp cognac<br>Put the flour, sugar and a pinch of salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre, add the eggs, oil and 2 tbsp of<br>the milk, and beat together with a wooden spoon until smooth. Slowly start to pour in a little milk, mixing as you<br>pour, to keep the batter smooth. Pour in the rest of the milk, a bit more quickly now, until it looks like single cream.<br>Finally, add the beer.<br>Heat a 15cm/6in crêpe pan. Measure 21⁄2 tbsp of the batter into a jug, then pour into the pan, moving it around<br>so the mixture swirls and fits the bottom of the pan. When the crêpe is golden underneath (in about 15 seconds<br>if pan is the right temperature), turn and cook for a further 30 seconds, until spotted brown.<br>Slide the crêpe on to a plate. Wipe the pan with oiled kitchen paper and continue frying until all the batter is<br>used, stacking the crêpes on top of each other as you cook them.<br>For the sauce, heat the butter and sugar in a deep frying pan (about 25cm/10in) over a low heat, stirring<br>occasionally, until the sugar begins to dissolve; turn up the heat and bubble quite fast, until the mixture just starts<br>to go brown and caramelise (about 4 minutes), stirring only towards the end. Pour in the orange juice (see left);<br>add the orange and lemon zests, letting the mixture bubble for 3-4 minutes to thicken slightly. Add the Grand<br>Marnier and cognac, heat for a few seconds and lower the heat.<br>Put one crêpe into the juices and, holding it with a fork, coat it well in the mixture. Fold it into quarters and push<br>to one side of the pan. Continue the coating and folding with the remaining pancakes. Serve 2-3 crêpes per<br>person with the sauce.am.
