BACON WRAPPED PORK 
FILLET WITH APPLE STUFFING
INGREDIENTS
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 medium apple, peeled and cut into small 
dice (about 1 cup)
1/4 medium yellow onion, finely chopped 
(about 1/3 cup)
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1 to 2 thick slices bread (enough to make 
1/2 cup coarse breadcrumbs)
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1/8 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
1/8 teaspoon pepper, plus more to taste
1 pork fillet (650gms)
8 to 10 strips bacon (about 360gms), cut in 
half
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Heat the oven to 220C.  In a pan over medium heat, 
heat the oil. Add the apple, onion, rosemary, and thyme, and 
cook for 7 to 9 minutes, or until softened. Meanwhile, pulse 
the bread slices in a food processor until you make coarse 
crumbs. You should have about 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs.
Step 2:  Remove the pan with the onions and apples from the 
heat, and stir in the breadcrumbs, mustard, salt, and pepper. 
Set aside to cool briefly.
Step 3:  Cut a deep lengthwise slit down the center of the 
tenderloin, stopping about 1.5cm from the bottom of the roast. 
Open it up like a book. Cover with a piece of plastic wrap, and 
with a mallet or rolling pin, gently pound it until it is of an even 
thickness.
Step 4:  Spread the stuffing in a line along the center of the 
meat. Bring the edges of the meat together to return it to its 
original shape. Secure with toothpicks.
Step 5:  Lay out the bacon slices on a cutting board, 
overlapping them slightly. Place the tenderloin on top with the 
toothpicks facing up. Removing the toothpicks as you work, 
wrap the bacon slices around the pork to form a log. Place 
the tenderloin, bacon seam side down, on the baking sheet.
Step 6:  Roast for 20 to 25 minutes. If the roast is ready before 
the bacon browns, place the tenderloin under the broiler for 3 
to 5 minutes to brown the bacon.
Step 7:  Let the tenderloin rest for 10 minutes before cutting 
into slices:
Step 8:  Serve with the pan juices spooned over top if desired.
