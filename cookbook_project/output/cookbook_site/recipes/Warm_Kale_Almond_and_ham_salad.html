The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.<br>Warm Kale, Almond and ham salad<br>2 shallots, sliced into rounds <br>2 tsp vegetable oil<br>200g kale, large stalks removed, leaves roughly torn <br>4-6 slices serrano ham or your choice of cured ham <br>3 celery stalks, thinly sliced on an angle<br>shavings of Manchego cheese, to garnish (optional)<br>2 tbsp sherry vinegar<br>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil <br>2 tsp Dijon mustard<br>pinch of sugar<br>2 tbsp raisins<br>2 tbsp whole blanched almonds <br>½ tsp vegetable oil<br>good pinch of sweet smoked paprika<br>1.  Heat oven to 200C. Toss the shallots with 1 tsp oil on a large non-stick baking tray. Separate the <br>rings a little as you turn them in the oil. Roast for 10 mins, stirring halfway, until starting to soften and <br>turn golden here and there.<br>2.  In a large bowl, whisk the vinegar, oil, mustard, sugar and some seasoning together to make the <br>dressing, then tip in the raisins and leave to soak. In a smaller roasting tin, toss the almonds, oil, papri- <br>ka and a pinch of sea salt. Rub the kale all over with 1 tsp vegetable oil and some seasoning.<br>3.  Remove the shallot tray from the oven, mix in the kale (it’s fine if it mounds a bit), then return the tray <br>to the oven and put the almonds on the shelf below. Roast for 7 mins, giving the kale a turn halfway <br>through, until crisp in some places, wilted in others.<br>4.  Ruffle the ham onto serving plates. Tip the kale, shallots and celery into the dressing bowl, make <br>sure it coats the kale well, then mound on top of the ham and scatter with the almonds and the <br>cheese, if using.
