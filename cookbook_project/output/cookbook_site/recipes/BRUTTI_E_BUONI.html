240g  blanched hazelnuts
160gms confectioners' sugar
Pinch of salt
2 large egg white, lightly beaten
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
Instructions
Step 1: Preheat the oven to 200°C. Spread the hazelnuts on a 
large rimmed baking sheet and toast for about 12 minutes, 
until the nuts are fragrant then remove and set aside to cool.  
Alternatively, lightly toast the almonds in a pan.
Step 2:  In a food processor, pulse the cooled hazelnuts with 
the confectioners' sugar and salt until finely chopped. Scrape 
the hazelnut mixture into a medium bowl. 
Step 3:  Whisk the egg whites until just at soft peaks, now add 
the vanilla and finally the ground hazelnut flour, stir gently until 
combined.
Step 4:  Line the baking sheet with parchment paper. Spoon 
tablespoon-size mounds of the hazelnut dough onto the 
prepared baking sheet 2.5cm apart.
Step 5:  Bake the cookies in the center of the oven for about 
14 minutes, until browned in spots (about 13 minutes for 
chewy cookies and 15 minutes for slightly crisp cookies). Let 
the cookies cool on the baking sheet before serving.
