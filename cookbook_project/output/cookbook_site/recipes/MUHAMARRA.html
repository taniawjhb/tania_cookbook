For the dip<br>2 red bell peppers<br>4 tablespoon Extra Virgin Olive Oil <br>divided<br>125g shelled toasted walnuts<br>1 garlic clove roughly chopped<br>2 ½ tablespoon tomato paste<br>¾ cup bread crumbs<br>2 tablespoon pomegranate molasses<br>1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper<br>½ teaspoon sugar<br>1 teaspoon sumac<br>½ teaspoon salt<br>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper optional<br>Instructions<br>Step 1:  Preheat the oven to 220C.<br>Step 2:  Brush the bell peppers with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, <br>and place in a lightly oiled oven-safe pan or cast-iron skillet. <br>Roast the peppers in the 220C heated oven for 30 minutes or <br>so, turning them over once or twice.<br>Step 3:  Remove from the oven and place the peppers in a <br>bowl. Cover with plastic wrap for a few minutes. This traps the <br>steam from the roasted peppers, making them easy to peel. <br>When cool enough to handle, simply peel the peppers, <br>remove the seeds and slice the peppers into small strips.<br>Step 4:  Now in the bowl of a large food processor, combine <br>the roasted red pepper strips with 3 tablespoon extra virgin <br>olive oil, garlic, walnuts, tomato paste, bread crumbs, <br>pomegranate molasses, Aleppo pepper, sugar, sumac, salt <br>and cayenne. Blend into a smooth paste.<br>Step 5:  Transfer to a serving bowl. You may cover the <br>muhammara and refrigerate, but be sure to bring the dip to <br>room temperature before serving.<br>MUHAMARRA
