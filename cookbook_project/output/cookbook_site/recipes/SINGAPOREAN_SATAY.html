INGREDIENTS
500g boneless, skinless chicken thighs, 
chopped into 1/2-inch cubes
1 onion or 5 small shallots, chopped
2 garlic cloves
4 lemongrass, white inner core, sliced
1-inch ginger, chopped
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground coriander
1/2 tsp turmeric powder
1 tsp salt, or to taste
2 tbsps palm sugar
1/4 cup water, for easier blending
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Add onions or shallots, garlic, ginger, lemongrass, 
ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric powder, salt and 
palm sugar to a blender. Add water for easier blending. Blitz 
until a smooth paste forms.
Step 2:   Add chopped chicken bites in a container. Pour in the 
blended paste into the container. Massage marinade onto 
chicken, coating each piece evenly. Allow to marinade for 2 
hours, overnight is best for full flavour infusion.
Step 3:  Soak bamboo skewers in water for at least 20 
minutes before use. Take a piece of marinated chicken, and 
carefully skewer with the sticks. Stop the chicken halfway 
through the sticks. Continue until the chicken or the bamboo 
skewers are all used up.
Step 4:  Before cooking, prepare a bowl of coconut oil and a 
brush on the side. Cook the Chicken Satays according to your 
preferred method:
Grilling:
1. Grill the skewers over an open flame or on a grill until the 
chicken is cooked to perfection. Make sure the grill is hot 
before putting on the satays.
2. Continuously brush the oil on the chicken pieces to keep 
them moist.
