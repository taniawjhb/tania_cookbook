The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.<br>Pasteis de Bacalhau<br>What Portuguese menu would be complete without cod fish!<br>250 g boiled bacalhau<br>300 g potatoes, boiled with skin on<br>2 tbsp milk<br>2 eggs<br>1 onion, fine chopped<br>Half cup chopped parsley<br>1tsp paprika<br>Black pepper & salt to taste<br>Fine sliced red chilli (optional)<br><br><br><h2>Method</h2><br>1. Take your frozen bacalhau and submerge in water for 2-3 days (depending on flavour), changing the water half-daily<br>2. Put your potatoes on to boil for 35 min with skin on. Then boil the bacalhau in water for 15-20 minutes (depending on<br>size), adding 1 bayleaf to the water (this helps with surviving the smell)<br>3. Once boiled, remove skin and ALL bones, then shred the fish into tiny fibres using a pestle and mortar (Its quite a task, but<br>worth it as my mom always said)<br>4. Peel your cooked potatoes, then mash them. DO NOT USE A FOOD PROCESSOR.<br>5. Add your shredded fish, potatoes, chopped parsley, diced onion, paprika and chilli then stir well. Add your eggs one at a<br>time, stirring as you do.<br>6. Shape your uncooked fritters with two dessert spoons, then shallow fry them in quite a bit of oil, turning them every minute<br>or so.<br>7. Once golden throughout, remove and drain on some kitchen paper.
