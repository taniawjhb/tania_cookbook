Discard<br>both ends of the cucumber. Thinly (about 0.5 cm (0.2 inches)<br>thickness) slice the cucumber and put them into a large mixing<br>bowl. Add the salt and lightly mix them together. Leave it for 15<br>mins.<br>While waiting, thinly slice the onion. Prepare the seasoning<br>sauce by mixing them all together.<br>Fifteen mins later, rinse the cucumber in cold running water (any<br>remaining salt in the mixing bowl should be discarded) and<br>drain the water out using a strainer. Pat dry the cucumber<br>thoroughly with kitchen paper. Put them into a clean and dry<br>mixing bowl.<br>Add the sliced onion and the seasoning sauce. Mix them lightly<br>but thoroughly with your hand (You will want to wear a food<br>prep glove).<br>Put the seasoned cucumber into a sealed glass container and<br>keep it in the fridge for 30 mins to chill then serve. Enjoy!
