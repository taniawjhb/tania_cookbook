OI MUCHIM
1 cucumber (145 g / 5.1 ounces) - I used
Lebanese cucumber. Korean cucumber or
other cucumbers that are suitable for pickling
or salad can be used.
1/4 onion
1 Tbsp rock salt or Korean coarse sea salt
1 Tbsp Korean chili flakes (gochugaru)
1 tsp white vinegar (or rice vinegar)
1 tsp white sugar
1 tsp minced garlic
1 tsp toasted sesame seeds
Rinse the cucumber thoroughly in cold running water. Discard
both ends of the cucumber. Thinly (about 0.5 cm (0.2 inches)
thickness) slice the cucumber and put them into a large mixing
bowl. Add the salt and lightly mix them together. Leave it for 15
mins.
While waiting, thinly slice the onion. Prepare the seasoning
sauce by mixing them all together.
Fifteen mins later, rinse the cucumber in cold running water (any
remaining salt in the mixing bowl should be discarded) and
drain the water out using a strainer. Pat dry the cucumber
thoroughly with kitchen paper. Put them into a clean and dry
mixing bowl.
Add the sliced onion and the seasoning sauce. Mix them lightly
but thoroughly with your hand (You will want to wear a food
prep glove).
Put the seasoned cucumber into a sealed glass container and
keep it in the fridge for 30 mins to chill then serve. Enjoy!
