DOUBLE CHOC ZUCCHINI 
MUFFINS
112 g vegetable oil
300 g granulated sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
256 g all-purpose flour
64 g unsweetened cocoa powder
1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
3 cups finely shredded zucchini, do not drain
210g semi-sweet chocolate chunks
STEP 1:  Preheat oven to 180C and prepare two muffin pan with 18 
cupcake liners. (You will have anywhere from 14-22 muffins depending 
on how full you fill them.)
STEP 2:  In a large bowl or in the bowl of a stand mixer, combine oil, 
sugar, and vanilla until fully incorporated.
STEP 3:  Add in the flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. 
Slowly stir the dry ingredients into the sugar mixture and mix until just 
combined - the mixture will appear very dry
STEP 4:  Add the grated zucchini and the chocolate chunks by hand.  
The mixture will appear as though it requires extra liquid, just give it a 
good mix until it appears wet through, avoid overworking it - the batter 
will appear very thick
STEP 5:  Scoop 3 tablespoons of muffin batter into each cupcake liner. 
Bake for 25-30 minutes.  They will remain fudgy looking but a skewer 
should come out clean.
