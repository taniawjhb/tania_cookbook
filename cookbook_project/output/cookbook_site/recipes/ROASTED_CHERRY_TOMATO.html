<pre>
300gms multicolored cherry tomatoes
2 garlic cloves, thickly sliced
5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus
more for drizzling
Salt & Pepper
4 thin slices of pancetta
32 sage leaves
1 pound fresh ricotta cheese
8 slices of country bread, cut 1/4-inch
thick and toasted
Flaky sea salt, for serving
Preheat the oven to 190C°. In a bowl, toss the tomatoes
with the garlic and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil; season
with kosher salt and pepper. Transfer the tomatoes to one
side of a parchment-lined baking sheet and lay the
pancetta slices out on the other side. Bake for 25 minutes,
until the pancetta is crisp. Transfer the pancetta to paper
towels to drain, then crumble.
Roast the tomatoes for about 10 more minutes, until
bursting and lightly caramelized. Transfer the tomatoes and
any rendered fat from the pancetta to a bowl.
Meanwhile, in a small skillet, heat the remaining 1/4 cup
of olive oil over moderately high heat. Add the sage and fry
until bright green and crisp, 30 to 45 seconds. Drain the
sage on paper towels; reserve the oil for another use.
Spread the ricotta on the toasts and top with the tomatoes
and crumbled pancetta. Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with
sea salt and pepper and top the toasts with the sage
leaves. Serve immediately.
