Cambodian Fish Amok
2 dried red chillies (see note), soaked in boiling water, drained, chopped
3 garlic cloves, chopped
1 tablespoon grated fresh turmeric (see note)
2 tablespoons grated galangal (see note)
2 lemongrass stems (inner core only), grated
2 eschalots, chopped
Finely grated zest of 1 lime
1 tablespoon shrimp paste (see note)
1/4 cup (65g) grated palm sugar (see note)
6  lime leaves, finely shredded (see note)
400ml coconut milk
400g skinless blue-eye fillet, cut into 3-4cm pieces
12 green prawns, peeled (tails intact), deveined
2 banana leaves (see note)
1 long red chilli, thinly sliced
Steamed rice, to serve
Combine the chilli, garlic, turmeric, galangal, lemongrass, eschalot, lime zest, shrimp paste, palm sugar, half the  lime
leaves and 2 teaspoons salt in a mortar and pestle or small food processor and pound or whiz until a fine paste.
Transfer paste to a frypan over medium heat and cook, stirring, for 3-4 minutes, until fragrant. Add the coconut milk (reserving
2 tablespoons for serving) and bring to a simmer. Remove from heat, transfer to a bowl and allow to cool slightly. Add the
seafood and toss to combine.
Cut each banana leaf into two 25cm x 15cm rectangles. Carefully wave both sides of each leaf over a medium-high flame,
then set aside (the heat from the flame will soften the leaves, making them more pliable). Lay each banana leaf out, divide
the seafood among the leaves and fold in the ends, securing with toothpicks to form 4 small trays. Top with remaining
marinade and sprinkle with remaining  lime leaves and half the sliced chilli. Place in a steamer over medium-high heat
and cook for 15 minutes or until the fish is tender and cooked through.
Place the seafood parcels on serving plates. Remove toothpicks, drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons coconut milk and
scatter with remaining sliced chilli. Serve with rice.
