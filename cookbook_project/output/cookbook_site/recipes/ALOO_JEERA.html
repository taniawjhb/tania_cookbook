Bring a pot of water to boil along with 1 tsp of turmeric<br>powder. Quarter the potatoes (no need to peel) and drop them<br>into the water once you start to see bubbles appear in the water.<br>Boil for about 10-15 minutes<br>Note: At the 10 minute mark, take a fork and poke your potatoes.<br>If the fork goes through cleanly, you're good to go. If they don't,<br>let them cook a bit more, checking every minute using the same<br>technique. You don't want to over boil them.<br>In a medium sized bowl (that can hold all the potatoes)<br>add the chickpea flour, remaining turmeric, salt, and red chili<br>powder and give it a good whisk.<br>Once the potatoes are done boiling, remove from heat<br>using a colander or slotted spoon.

Toast for<br>about 20 seconds taking care not to burn the seeds.<br>(Note: You can skip the mustard seeds if you don't have them,<br>and add the cumin seeds straight to the oil. If you plan to use<br>cumin powder, skip this step entirely and add the cumin powder<br>after you add the potatoes.)<br>Toss the potatoes into the skillet, taking care not to<br>overcrowd them. Give them a good stir and let them cook for<br>about 3 to 4 minutes. Then give them one more good stir and let<br>them cook another 3 to 4 minutes. Your potatoes should be<br>golden brown by this time. If not, give it a few more minutes until<br>they are.<br>Once they are golden brown, turn the heat off, garnish with<br>some curry leaves or cilantro if you wish, and serve hot with<br>naan, rice or any other main dish of choice.<br>2 tsp turmeric powder divided<br>1.5 tsp red chili powder I use Kashmiri chili<br>powder, which is potent; adjust to taste!<br>4 tbsp chickpea flour<br>2 tsp salt<br>4 tsp water to form slurry with chickpea flour<br>2 tbsp vegetable oil you can add extra if you<br>like<br>1 tsp mustard seeds skip if unavailable<br>1.5 tsp cumin seeds can substitute with<br>cumin powder - check recipe notes<br>6 potatoes medium, Yukon Gold<br>ALOO JEERA
