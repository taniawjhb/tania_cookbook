Bring a pot of water to boil along with 1 tsp of turmeric
powder. Quarter the potatoes (no need to peel) and drop them
into the water once you start to see bubbles appear in the water.
Boil for about 10-15 minutes
Note: At the 10 minute mark, take a fork and poke your potatoes.
If the fork goes through cleanly, you're good to go. If they don't,
let them cook a bit more, checking every minute using the same
technique. You don't want to over boil them.
In a medium sized bowl (that can hold all the potatoes)
add the chickpea flour, remaining turmeric, salt, and red chili
powder and give it a good whisk.
Once the potatoes are done boiling, remove from heat
using a colander or slotted spoon. Rinse the potatoes under cold
water to stop them from further cooking and peel the potatoes
(the peels should come right off)
Drop the peeled potatoes into the bowl with the spice
mix and give it a good toss to coat them evenly. Now, add
about 4 teaspoons of water to make sure the spices stick to the
potatoes. Don't add too much water!
In a skillet, heat vegetable oil on medium heat.
Once the oil starts to glisten, add mustard seeds. Then, once the
mustard seeds starts sputtering, add cumin seeds. Toast for
about 20 seconds taking care not to burn the seeds.
(Note: You can skip the mustard seeds if you don't have them,
and add the cumin seeds straight to the oil. If you plan to use
cumin powder, skip this step entirely and add the cumin powder
after you add the potatoes.)
Toss the potatoes into the skillet, taking care not to
overcrowd them. Give them a good stir and let them cook for
about 3 to 4 minutes. Then give them one more good stir and let
them cook another 3 to 4 minutes. Your potatoes should be
golden brown by this time. If not, give it a few more minutes until
they are.
Once they are golden brown, turn the heat off, garnish with
some curry leaves or cilantro if you wish, and serve hot with
naan, rice or any other main dish of choice.
