4 large egg yolks<br>3/4 cup granulated sugar <br>2 cups whole milk<br>1 cup heavy cream<br>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br>1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla <br>extract<br>240gms mascarpone<br>Step 1:  In a medium saucepan, whisk together the egg yolks <br>and sugar until smooth, thick, and pale yellow. This will take <br>around 30 seconds. Whisk in the milk, cream, salt and vanilla <br>until evenly combined.<br>Step 2:  Place the saucepan over medium heat. Whisking <br>almost constantly, cook the mixture until an instant-read <br>thermometer reads 170 degrees F, approximately 10 minutes.<br>Step 3:  Place the mascarpone cheese in a medium-sized bowl. <br>Carefully add one or two ladles of the hot gelato base and <br>whisk until smooth. Continue adding the hot liquid and <br>whisking until the mascarpone is completely incorporated.<br>Step 4:   Strain the gelato base through a fine mesh strainer into <br>a medium-size bowl, preferably one with a pouring spout.<br>Step 5:   Place plastic wrap directly against the surface of the <br>liquid to prevent a skin from forming. Chill until the mixture is <br>very cold, at least 6 hours or up to two days in advance.<br>Step 6:   Briefly whisk the mixture, then prepare in an ice cream <br>maker according to manufacturer instructions.<br>Step 7:   Once the gelato has finished spinning, it will likely be a <br>soft serve consistency. Transfer to a loaf pan (or similar sized <br>pan), cover, and freeze until fully frozen but scoopable, up to 2 <br>hours.<br>MASCARPONE GELATO
