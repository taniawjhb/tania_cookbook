Tandoori Chicken Skewers
6 Tbsp vegetable oil
2 teaspoon ground coriander
2 teaspoon ground cumin
2 teaspoon ground turmeric
2 teaspoon Kashmiri chili powder
2 Tbsp garam masala
2 Tbsp sweet (not hot) paprika
2 cup plain yogurt (can sub buttermilk)
4 Tbsp lemon juice
8 minced garlic cloves
4 Tbsp minced fresh ginger
2 teaspoon salt
10 chicken breasts cut into chunks (deboned thighs work very well)
1. Preheat the over to 200C, fan on. Soak skewers in water
2. Heat the oil in a small pan over medium heat, then cook the coriander, cumin, turmeric, cayenne, garam masala and
paprika, stirring often, until fragrant (approximately 2-3 minutes). Let cool.
3. Mix the spice mixture into the yogurt, add lemon juice, garlic, salt, ginger and stir till combined.
4. Coat the chicken pieces with the marinade, and chill for at least an hour (preferably 6 hours but no longer)
5. Thread the chicken pieces onto the skewers
6. Place the skewers on a roasting tray and roast in the hot oven till cooked through and slightly charred. Don’t overcrowd
the roasting tray and turn once during cooking.
Hint:  These are fantastic on the braai, brush the grid with some oil before placing the skewers on and cooking till charred
and ready.
