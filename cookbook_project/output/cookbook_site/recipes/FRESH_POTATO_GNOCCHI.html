FRESH POTATO GNOCCHI <br>LIGHT DELICATE DUMPLINGS<br><br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2><br>1kg floury potatoes, medium <br>Nicola are best <br>2 large eggs, beaten<br>300g plain flour - divided, <br>200g + 100g <br>1tbsp fine salt<br>Pinch of nutmeg<br><br><br><h2>Method</h2><br>1. Add the whole potatoes in their skins to a pot of salted boiling <br>water. Bring back to the boil and simmer for 10- 15 minutes until <br>just soft (will depend on th size of your potatoes). Test with a knife <br>– the potatoes should be cooked, but not overcooked, otherwise the <br>they will be mushy and will have absorbed too much water. Hold <br>them in a dish cloth to peel as they will be hot.<br>2.  Using a mouli/potato ricer/sieve press the potatoes into a bowl <br>or onto a clean work surface. Make a hollow in your pile of potatoes, <br>then pour in the egg, salt, nutmeg and sprinkle over 200g of flour. <br>Start to blend everything with your finger tips,. Work carefully and <br>quickly, as the more you handle the dough, the harder and bouncier <br>it will become. You need the same lightness you would use for <br>pastry.<br>3.  You should now have a soft dough that holds together, doesn’t <br>feel sticky and can be easily shaped. Flour the ourtside of it lightly <br>to make it easier to handle.<br>4.  Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces. Roll a piece at a time into <br>long, thumb-nail thick cylinders on a lightly floured surface, again <br>working lightly and quickly. As you roll you will also be gently <br>stretching the dough. Keep the surface well floured as you don’t <br>want the gnocchi to stick.<br>5.  Cut the dough into thumb-nail long lengths. To score the <br>gnocchi use the back of a fork pressed against the gnocchi.  This <br>will help to carry the sauce that you use, it is not ssential however.<br>6.  Bring a large, deep pot of salted water to the boil. Working with <br>a few at a time, drop in the gnocchi and listen for the wonderful <br>kissing noise they make as they go in. Let them cook for 2 minutes, <br>during which time they will bob back up to the surface, then scoop <br>them out with a slotted spoon. Taste - they should be sofficí e <br>leggeri (soft and light), the gnocchi equivalent of al dente.
