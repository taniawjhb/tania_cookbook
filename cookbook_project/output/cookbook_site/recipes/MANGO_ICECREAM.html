INGREDIENTS
1cup sugar
6 egg yolks
620ml milk
175ml cream
2-3 large mangoes
11/2 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tsp vanilla extract
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Peel and cut the mango into pieces. Squeeze as 
much flesh off as possible. Blend it in the blender or food 
processor along with the lemon juice. Strain the mango mix 
into a bowl, so that the stringy bits are eliminated from the 
puree. You should have about 1 1/4 cups mango puree.
Ice Cream base:
Step 2:  Whisk egg yolks and sugar till pale.
Step 3:  In a medium/heavy saucepan, bring milk and cream 
to a simmer. Turn off heat and whisk half of the mixture into 
the yolks.
Step 4:  Return everything to the sauce pan over a very low 
heat and keep on stirring it till it thickens.
Step 5:  Remove from heat and strain it into a large bowl. Let it 
cool for 5 or 6 minutes and then mix in mango puree.
Step 6:  Chill the mix until ice cold, overnight or in an ice bath.  
Then 10 mins before processing in the ice cream machine, put 
the mango custard into the freezer and also put the ice cream 
dasher into the freezer. (this SHOCKS the mix so that not much 
air is whipped in).
Step 7:  Process in your ice cream maker until set, chill in the 
freezer for a firmer ice cream.
