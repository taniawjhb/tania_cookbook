Squeeze as <br>much flesh off as possible. Blend it in the blender or food <br>processor along with the lemon juice.

Turn off heat and whisk half of the mixture into <br>the yolks.<br>Step 4:  Return everything to the sauce pan over a very low <br>heat and keep on stirring it till it thickens.<br>Step 5:  Remove from heat and strain it into a large bowl. Let it <br>cool for 5 or 6 minutes and then mix in mango puree.<br>Step 6:  Chill the mix until ice cold, overnight or in an ice bath.  <br>Then 10 mins before processing in the ice cream machine, put <br>the mango custard into the freezer and also put the ice cream <br>dasher into the freezer. (this SHOCKS the mix so that not much <br>air is whipped in).<br>Step 7:  Process in your ice cream maker until set, chill in the <br>freezer for a firmer ice cream.<br>MANGO ICECREAM
