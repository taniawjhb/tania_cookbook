CHICKEN & CORN SOUP<br>8 cups good-quality chicken stock or<br>vegetable stock, divided<br>3 cups diced or shredded cooked chicken<br>breasts*<br>2 teaspoons ground ginger<br>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder<br>4 green onions, thinly sliced with the white<br>and green parts divided<br>2 medium carrots, finely diced<br>1 (15-ounce) can whole kernel corn<br>1 (15 ounce) can creamed corn (or see<br>alternative below**)<br>1/4 cup cornstarch<br>6 large eggs, whisked<br>1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil<br>sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper<br>In a large stockpot, stir together 7 cups stock, chicken, ginger,<br>garlic powder, the white parts of the green onions, carrots, whole<br>kernel corn and creamed corn until combined.  Heat over<br>medium heat until the soup reaches a simmer.  Then reduce<br>heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for about 10 minutes, or<br>until the carrots have softened.<br>In a separate bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 cup stock<br>and cornstarch until combined.  Stir the mixture into the soup<br>and cook for 1 minute, or until the soup has thickened.<br>Using a spoon, begin to swirl the soup slowly in a continuous<br>motion.  Then while you are still swirling the soup, drizzle the<br>eggs into the soup in a steady stream.  The hot broth will<br>instantly cook the eggs, and they will form those beautiful egg<br>ribbons.<br>Add in the toasted sesame oil, and stir to combine.  Then taste<br>the soup, and season with salt and pepper as needed.<br>Serve warm, sprinkled with the remaining green parts of the<br>green onions.
