Chicken Saltimbocca
4 180gm skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, butterflied and lightly pounded
Salt and freshly ground pepper
8 large sage leaves
4 thin slices prosciutto di Parma
All-purpose flour, for dusting
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into tablespoons
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons dry white wine
1 cup chicken stock or low-sodium broth
Step 1
Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Place 2 sage leaves on each breast. Top with a slice of prosciutto,
trimming it to fit. Press the prosciutto to help it adhere to the chicken. Dust the chicken with flour, shaking off the
excess.
Step 2
Heat a large skillet. Add the oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter. Add 2 of the breasts, prosciutto side up, and
cook over high heat until nearly cooked through, about 3 minutes. Turn the chicken and cook just until the
prosciutto begins to shrink, about 1 minute. Transfer the chicken to a plate; repeat with the remaining chicken.
Pour off any fat and wipe out the skillet.
Step 3
Add the remaining butter to the skillet. Add the wine and cook over high heat until reduced by half, 2 minutes.
Add the stock and bring to a boil. Cook until reduced by half, 3 minutes.
Step 4
Return the chicken to the skillet, prosciutto side up, and simmer over moderate heat until the chicken is cooked
through, about 2 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Transfer the chicken to plates, pour the sauce on top and
serve.
