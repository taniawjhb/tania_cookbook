Chicken Fajita
450gms skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut in half
3 tbsp fajita seasoning
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 green bell peppers, chopped
1 red bell peppers, chopped 1 onion, chopped
Fresh chopped chilli, cilantro, spring onion, etc
Toss the chicken with the fajita seasoning, then, heat some oil in a non stick frying pan. Add the chicken when
the oil is hot, do not overcrowd the pan. Allow to brown for 2-minutes before turning, allow to brown, remove
and set aside - keeping warm. Repeat until all the chicken is finished. It is ok if the chicken is a little pink it will
finish cooking in the peppers.
Heat a little extra oil in the same frying pan over medium heat. Stir in the green bell peppers, red bell peppers,
onion and cook until the peppers have begun to soften. Once the veggies are almost cooked stir in the chicken
and allow and chicken. Cook and stir until the vegetables have softened, about 10 minutes.
If you are using any optional extras top the cooked chicken with then and serve with warm soft tortillas
