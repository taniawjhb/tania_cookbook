SESAME HONEY BANANA<br>FRITTERS<br>4 to 5 big ripe bananas , cut into 1-inch<br>chunks<br>Oil for deep frying<br>Honey & lightly toasted sesame seeds to<br>serve with<br>1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br>1/2 cup cornstarch<br>2 tablespoons milk (or plant-based milk for a<br>vegan dish)<br>1 tablespoon butter , melted<br>1 tablespoon granulated sugar<br>1/2 cup water<br>Combine all the <br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2> for the batter in a big bowl. Stir to<br>mix well. It should form a runny batter similar in consistency to a<br>pancake batter.<br>Heat 1 inch of oil in a small deep pot over medium-high heat<br>until hot. Test the oil by inserting a wooden chopstick. If the oil<br>sizzles and you can see small bubbles rising rapidly on the<br>chopstick, the oil is ready.<br>Line a large plate or baking sheet with a cooling rack. Add the<br>chopped bananas into the batter, a few pieces at a time, and<br>coat well. Gently transfer the bananas into the oil. Fry until all<br>sides turn golden brown. Transfer onto the cooling rack to drain<br>the extra oil. Fry all the bananas this way in batches.<br>Wait until the bananas cool down slightly. They will continue to<br>crisp.<br>Serve hot with honey and toasted sesame seeds
