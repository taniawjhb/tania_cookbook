<pre>
1 cup long-grain rice
1 small onion
1 stick celery finely chopped
1 small carrot finely chopped 4 
tbs. butter
3 cups chicken broth
5 tbs. grated Parmigiano
80 gms finely diced Mozzarella 
10 - 12 anchovy fillets
30gms parsley, chopped
1 egg
3 eggs 
breadcrumbs 
nutmeg
olive oil
salt
pepper
Flour
In a heavy based pot saute the onion, carrot and celery 
in the butter until soft and translucent.  Then add the rice and fry 
it until it is sizzling.  Then add the hot broth slowly, stirring 
frequently. The rice should be done in about 20 min. When the 
rice is ready, mix in half the parmesan, and then spread the rice 
out in a flat baking tray to cool.
Mix the chopped mozzarella and finely chopped 
anchovies, the rest of the parmesan, the chopped parsley, 1 egg, 
nutmeg, salt and pepper (If the mixture is a little wet add some 
more parmesan). With slightly damp hands, take a handful of 
rice in one hand, and a pinch of stuffing with the other. Push the 
stuffing into the middle of the rice. Squeeze the rice all around 
the stuffing and mould it into an egg shape.
When you have used up all the mix, flour the croquettes, 
dip into beaten eggs, and then roll again in breadcrumbs. Fry the 
suppli' in very hot oil, once golden and cooked through place on 
paper towel to darin and serve immediately
