<pre>
700gms beef fillet
45gms black pepper corns
4tbsp fresh thyme leaves
3 lemons
100g parmesan
150gms wild rocket leaves
Extra Virgin Olive Oil as needed
Roughly crush the black pepper and 1 tbsp salt in a mortar, place in
a single layer on a chopping board.
Preheat a grill or a pan to very hot. Roll the fillet in the salt and
pepper mix, then briefly grill, turning continuously to blacken the
outsides, but making sure that the centre remains raw. Remove
and place in fridge
Slice the cold fillet into 1/2cm slices on a board. Using a large
pointed cooking knife, press and spread the slices to make them
thin and lacy. The grilled edges will hold the pieces together.
To make the Thyme Salmoriglio, pound 4 level tablespoons fresh
thyme with 1 teaspoon sea salt until completely crushed. Add 2
tablespoons lemon juice. Pour 8 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
slowly into the mixture. Add a little freshly ground black pepper.
Spread out the slices on the plate, and spoon over the thyme
sauce. Lightly toss the rocket leaves with the oil and Lemon
Dressing.
