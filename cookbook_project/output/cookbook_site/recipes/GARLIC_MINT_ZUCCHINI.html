2 courgettes (zucchinis)<br>2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil<br>1 garlic clove, (peeled but not sliced)<br>1 handful fresh mint<br>juice of ¼ lemon<br>salt and pepper, to taste<br>Instructions<br>Step 1: First, cut the zucchini into 3cm x .5cm batons.<br>[Optional pre-salting the zucchini - Place the zucchini batons <br>in a colander set over a bowl and liberally sprinkle salt over <br>them. Quickly mix the salt into the courgettes with your hands <br>and leave for 5-10 minutes so that the salt can draw out the <br>juices from the courgette. Once the batons look wet and <br>glistening, rinse them under the tap in the colander to wash <br>away all the salt and any juices. Then dry in a clean tea towel <br>or kitchen towel.]<br>Step 2:  In the meantime, slice the fresh mint thinly. <br>Step 3:  Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. <br>Once hot, add the whole garlic clove and move around in the <br>pan to brown on all sides and flavour the oil. Once browned, <br>remove from the pan and discard (or use to flavour in <br>something else).<br>Step 4:  Add the courgette batons in one single layer. Do not <br>overlap the batons. You may need to sauté the courgette <br>batons in batches. Sauté the courgette batons until the <br>underside is golden brown (about 2-4 minutes), then, using a <br>pair of kitchen tongs, turn each slice over to cook on all the <br>other side. Cook until golden brown on all sides.<br>Step 5:  Once cooked, add the chopped mint and a squeeze <br>of lemon juice and stir over the heat for 30 seconds until the <br>mint has wilted and the lemon juice is mixed into the <br>courgette batons. (If cooking in batches, add the pre-cooked <br>slices back into the pan at this point and stir all together over <br>the heat). Season with salt and pepper to your taste.  Serve <br>hot.<br>GARLIC & MINT ZUCCHINI
