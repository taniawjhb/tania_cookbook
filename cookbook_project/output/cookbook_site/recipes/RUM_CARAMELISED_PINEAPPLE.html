RUM CARAMELISED PINEAPPLE
4 small pineapples, peeled, cut into rings and cored
3tbsp brown sugar
60gms butter
2 tbsp vanilla rum
To start, peel the pineapples, then carefully remove any hard core. Now sprinkle both sides of the sliced
pineapples with the brown sugar.
Then in a non stick frying pan, heat the butter until foaming, add the pineapple slices and cook for two minutes a
side or until golden brown, flip and repeat. Remove and set aside in a serving platter.
Repeat until all the pineapple is cooked (if you require extra butter you can add). Once all the pineapple is
cooked add the rum and a little extra butter to the pan, bring to the boil and then pour over pineapple slices.
Serve warm with some yoghurt.
