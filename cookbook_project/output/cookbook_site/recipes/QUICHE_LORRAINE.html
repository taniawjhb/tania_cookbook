QUICHE LORRAINE<br>175g plain flour<br>100g cold butter, cut into pieces<br>1 egg yolk<br>For the pastry, put the flour, butter, egg yolk and 4 tsp cold water<br>into a food processor. Using the pulse button, process until the<br>mix binds. Tip the pastry onto a lightly floured surface, gather into<br>a smooth ball, then roll out as thinly as you can. Line a 23 x<br>2.5cm loose-bottomed, fluted flan tin, easing the pastry into the<br>base. Trim the pastry edges with scissors (save any trimmings) so<br>it sits slightly above the tin (if it shrinks, it shouldn’t now go below<br>the level of the tin). Press the pastry into the flutes, lightly prick the<br>base with a fork, then chill for 10 mins. Put a baking sheet in the<br>oven and heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6.\<br>Line pastry case with foil, shiny side down, fill with dry beans<br>and bake on the hot sheet for 15 mins. Remove foil and beans<br>and bake for 4-5 mins more until the pastry is pale golden. If<br>you notice any small holes or cracks, patch up with pastry<br>trimmings. You can make up to this point a day ahead.<br>While the pastry cooks, prepare the filling.<br>200g pack lardon, unsmoked or smoked<br>50g Gruyère<br>200ml carton crème fraîche<br>200ml double cream<br>3 eggs well beaten<br>pinch ground nutmeg<br>Heat a small frying pan, tip in the lardons and fry for a couple of<br>mins. Drain off any liquid that comes out, then continue cooking<br>until the lardons just start to colour, but aren’t crisp. Remove and<br>drain on paper towels. Cut three quarters of the cheese into<br>small dice and finely grate the rest. Scatter the diced cheese and<br>fried lardons over the bottom of the pastry case.<br>Using a spoon, beat the crème fraîche to slacken it then slowly<br>beat in the double cream. Mix in the beaten eggs. Season (you<br>shouldn’t need much salt) and add nutmeg. Pour three-quarters<br>of the filling into the pastry case.<br>Half-pull the oven shelf out and put the flan tin on the baking<br>sheet. Quickly pour the rest of the filling into the pastry case –<br>you get it right to the top this way. Scatter the grated cheese over<br>the top, then carefully push the shelf back into the oven. Lower<br>the oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Bake for about 25 mins, or<br>until golden and softly set (the centre should not feel too firm). Let<br>the quiche settle for 4-5 mins, then remove from the tin. Serve<br>freshly baked, although it’s also good cold.
