ROASTED ZAATAR AUBERGINES
Loaded with flavour!
1 globe eggplant
1 ½ tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon zataar spice mix
1 tablespoon Ras el Hanout
¼ teaspoon salt, more to taste
1 fat garlic clove
Preheat oven to 200C
Slice Eggplant in half, then slice deeply at a diagonal at
one inch intervals -“crosshatching”( see photos above) careful not
to cut through skin.
Season each side with ⅛ teaspoon kosher salt,
sprinkling it into the slices if possible.
Mix oil, spices, garlic together in a bowl to make a
paste. Brush or spoon the entire contents over the eggplant and
place on a sheet pan in the oven and bake for 1 hour rotating
halfway through. After an hour, pierce with a fork and if they are
very tender and juicy, they are are done. Bigger eggplants may
take longer.
½ cup tahini paste ( liquids and solids
both– not just the “oil”. )
¼ cup warm tap water, more to desired
consistency.
1–2 tablespoons lemon juice ( or add to
taste)
2 garlic cloves (finely minced)
½ teaspoon kosher salt ( see notes)
¼ teaspoon pepper
If your tahini paste has separated try to mix it in the jar
with a fork before measuring. If it’s very cold, this may not work
very well, so be sure to use both the solids and the oil.
Make the tahini sauce in a medium bowl, start by
adding the tahini.
If your tahini sauce is very cold, whisk using a fork or
mini whisk, with the warm water. Start with ¼ cup warm water,
and add more to desired consistency. ( ½ cup) for a looser
“dressing” consistency. Or feel free to keep it thick. Also keep in
mind, different brands of tahini paste are thicker than others.
Once you start whisking, it will actually thicken.
dd the remaining ingredients to the jar – lemon juice,
minced garlic, salt, pepper and whisk until creamy and smooth.
It will thick as it cools in fridge.
Taste and adjust salt and lemon to your liking.
