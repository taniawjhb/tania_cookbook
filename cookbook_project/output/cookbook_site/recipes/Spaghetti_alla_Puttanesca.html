The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.<br>Spaghetti alla Puttanesca<br>Spaghetti in the style of “whores”<br>450g dried spaghetti<br>1/2 cup (120ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided<br>4 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced or finely chopped by hand (see note above)<br>4 to 6 anchovy fillets, finely chopped (20–30ml chopped anchovy)<br>Large pinch red pepper flakes<br>1/4 cup capers, drained and chopped (60g)<br>1/4 cup chopped pitted black olives (60g)<br>1 (14-ounce; about 400g) can whole peeled tomatoes, preferably San Marzano, roughly broken up by hand<br>Small handful minced fresh parsley leaves<br>1 ounce (30g) finely grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving<br>Freshly ground black pepper<br>1. In a medium skillet, combine 6 tablespoons oil, garlic, anchovies, and red pepper flakes. Cook over medium<br>heat until garlic is very lightly golden, about 5 minutes. (Adjust heat as necessary to keep it gently sizzling.) Add<br>capers and olives and stir to combine.<br>2. Add chopped and deseeded tomatoes, stir to combine, and bring to a bare simmer. Continue to simmer until<br>tomatoes have started to break down and flavours have balanced nicely.<br>3, Now cook your spaghetti to just under al dente (about 1 minute less than the package recommends).<br>4. Using tongs, transfer pasta to sauce. Alternatively, drain pasta through a colander, reserving 1 cup of the<br>cooking water. Add drained pasta to sauce.<br>5. Add a few tablespoons of pasta water to sauce and increase heat to bring pasta and sauce to a vigorous<br>simmer. Cook, stirring and shaking the pan and adding more pasta water as necessary to keep sauce loose,<br>until pasta is perfectly al dente, 1 to 2 minutes longer. (The pasta will cook more slowly in the sauce than it did in<br>the water.) Stir in remaining olive oil, parsley, and cheese.<br>6. Season with salt and pepper. (Be generous with the pepper and scant with the salt—the dish will be plenty<br>salty from the other <br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2>.) If using, stir in canned tuna and break it up with a fork. Serve immediately with<br>more grated cheese at the table.
