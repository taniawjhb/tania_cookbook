LEMON BLUEBERRY BISCUITS
250g all-purpose flour, plus more for hands
and work surface
75g granulated sugar
1 Tablespoon fresh lemon zest (about 1
lemon)
2 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
115g unsalted butter, frozen
120ml heavy cream (plus 2 Tbsp for brushing)
1 large egg
1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
180g fresh or frozen blueberries (do not thaw)
for topping: coarse sugar
120g confectioners’ sugar
3 Tablespoons fresh lemon juice (about 1
large lemon)
Whisk flour, sugar, lemon zest, baking powder, and salt
together in a large bowl. Grate the frozen butter using a box
grater. Add it to the flour mixture and combine with a pastry
cutter, two forks, or your fingers until the mixture comes together
in pea-sized crumbs. Place in the refrigerator or freezer as you
mix the wet ingredients together.
Whisk 1/2 cup heavy cream, the egg, and vanilla extract
together in a small bowl. Drizzle over the flour mixture, add the
blueberries, then mix together until everything appears
moistened.
Pour onto the counter and, with floured hands, work
dough into a ball as best you can. Dough will be sticky. If it’s too
sticky, add a little more flour. If it seems too dry, add 1-2 more
Tablespoons heavy cream. Press into an 8-inch disc and, with a
sharp knife or bench scraper, cut into 8 wedges.
Brush scones with remaining heavy cream and for extra
crunch, sprinkle with coarse sugar. (You can do this before or
after refrigerating in the next step.)
Place scones on a plate or lined baking sheet (if your
fridge has space!) and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 200°C.
Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or
silicone baking mat. After refrigerating, arrange scones 2-3
inches apart on the prepared baking sheet(s).
Bake for 22-25 minutes or until golden brown around
the edges and lightly browned on top. Remove from the oven
and cool for a few minutes before topping with lemon icing.
Whisk the icing ingredients together. Drizzle over
warm scones.
