Secret Sunday Brunch in partnership with Pierre Jourdan<br>#anytimebubbly<br>LEMON BLUEBERRY BISCUITS<br>250g all-purpose flour, plus more for hands<br>and work surface<br>75g granulated sugar<br>1 Tablespoon fresh lemon zest (about 1<br>lemon)<br>2 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br>1/2 teaspoon salt<br>115g unsalted butter, frozen<br>120ml heavy cream (plus 2 Tbsp for brushing)<br>1 large egg<br>1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract<br>180g fresh or frozen blueberries (do not thaw)<br>for topping: coarse sugar<br>120g confectioners’ sugar<br>3 Tablespoons fresh lemon juice (about 1<br>large lemon)<br>Whisk flour, sugar, lemon zest, baking powder, and salt<br>together in a large bowl. Grate the frozen butter using a box<br>grater. Add it to the flour mixture and combine with a pastry<br>cutter, two forks, or your fingers until the mixture comes together<br>in pea-sized crumbs. Place in the refrigerator or freezer as you<br>mix the wet <br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2> together.<br>Whisk 1/2 cup heavy cream, the egg, and vanilla extract<br>together in a small bowl. Drizzle over the flour mixture, add the<br>blueberries, then mix together until everything appears<br>moistened.<br>Pour onto the counter and, with floured hands, work<br>dough into a ball as best you can. Dough will be sticky. If it’s too<br>sticky, add a little more flour. If it seems too dry, add 1-2 more<br>Tablespoons heavy cream. Press into an 8-inch disc and, with a<br>sharp knife or bench scraper, cut into 8 wedges.<br>Brush scones with remaining heavy cream and for extra<br>crunch, sprinkle with coarse sugar. (You can do this before or<br>after refrigerating in the next step.)<br>Place scones on a plate or lined baking sheet (if your<br>fridge has space!) and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes.<br>Meanwhile, preheat oven to 200°C.<br>Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or<br>silicone baking mat. After refrigerating, arrange scones 2-3<br>inches apart on the prepared baking sheet(s).<br>Bake for 22-25 minutes or until golden brown around<br>the edges and lightly browned on top. Remove from the oven<br>and cool for a few minutes before topping with lemon icing.<br>Whisk the icing ingredients together. Drizzle over<br>warm scones.
