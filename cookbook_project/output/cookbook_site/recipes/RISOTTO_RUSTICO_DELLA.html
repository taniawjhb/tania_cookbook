Wash the liver well <br>with water and place it in water and wine vinegar while the <br>vegetables are browning ; this is to remove some of its <br>flavor that not everyone loves. Brown the soffrito and then <br>add the minced meat and the rinsed chicken liver and the <br>spoons of tomato preserve diluted in a ladle of hot broth. At <br>this point you can salt the meat.<br>Step 3:  Continue cooking slowly and covered, for about 40 <br>minutes, with a glass of red wine and, if this is not enough, <br>adding a little broth.<br>Step 4:  For the last 10 minutes, uncover the pot to thicken <br>the sauce, break up the liver with a fork and mix it all <br>together.<br>Step 5:  Now prepare the risotto, by placing the butter in a <br>saucepan and adding the finely chopped onion.<br>Step 6:  When the browning process is finished, add the rice <br>and toast for two minutes, stirring constantly with a wooden <br>ladle. Start by adding, little by little, the very hot meat broth, <br>stirring often and keeping the flame on medium heat.<br>Step 7:  Bring the rice up slowly, adding the broth little by <br>little and letting it absorb before adding more.<br>Step 8:  Once you have reached two thirds of the cooking <br>time, add about half of the meat sauce, which must be hot. <br>When the rice is cooked, taste for salt and adjust if <br>necessary.<br>Step 9:  Stir in the grated parmesan. Serve hot and, on top of <br>the risotto, put two good spoonfuls of the meat sauce. <br>Sprinkle with freshly ground pepper. It will also be delicious <br>with an aromatic pepper.
