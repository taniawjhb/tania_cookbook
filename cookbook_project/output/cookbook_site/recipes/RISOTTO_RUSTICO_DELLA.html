Method
For the Meat Sauce
Step 1:  Let's start preparing the sauce by cleaning and 
washing the vegetables, put them in the blender or chop 
them with the mezzaluna, the mince must be a little coarse, 
but not rough.
Step 2:  Place three tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in 
the pan, then place it on medium heat. Wash the liver well 
with water and place it in water and wine vinegar while the 
vegetables are browning ; this is to remove some of its 
flavor that not everyone loves. Brown the soffrito and then 
add the minced meat and the rinsed chicken liver and the 
spoons of tomato preserve diluted in a ladle of hot broth. At 
this point you can salt the meat.
Step 3:  Continue cooking slowly and covered, for about 40 
minutes, with a glass of red wine and, if this is not enough, 
adding a little broth.
Step 4:  For the last 10 minutes, uncover the pot to thicken 
the sauce, break up the liver with a fork and mix it all 
together.
Step 5:  Now prepare the risotto, by placing the butter in a 
saucepan and adding the finely chopped onion.
Step 6:  When the browning process is finished, add the rice 
and toast for two minutes, stirring constantly with a wooden 
ladle. Start by adding, little by little, the very hot meat broth, 
stirring often and keeping the flame on medium heat.
Step 7:  Bring the rice up slowly, adding the broth little by 
little and letting it absorb before adding more.
Step 8:  Once you have reached two thirds of the cooking 
time, add about half of the meat sauce, which must be hot. 
When the rice is cooked, taste for salt and adjust if 
necessary.
Step 9:  Stir in the grated parmesan. Serve hot and, on top of 
the risotto, put two good spoonfuls of the meat sauce. 
Sprinkle with freshly ground pepper. It will also be delicious 
with an aromatic pepper.
