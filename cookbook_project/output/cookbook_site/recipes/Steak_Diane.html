Steak Diane
4 x small sirloin steaks, approx 200gms.
3 shallots, peeled
4 ounces crimini mushrooms, cleaned (if crimini unavailable use button mushrooms instead)
1 tablespoon salted butter
1 garlic clove, peeled
1 -2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, to taste
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1/3 cup brandy or cognac
1 cup heavy cream
Small handful of flat-leaf parsley
Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, roll out the steaks to flatten and cut off any excess fat. Season the steaks on both sides
with salt and pepper. Heat a little olive oil in a skillet pan large enough to accommodate the 4 steaks in one layer. Quickly
sauté the steaks for up to a minute on each side then remove from the pan and set aside to rest.
To make the sauce for the steaks, heat some olive oil in a separate pan. Slice the shallots and add to the pan, allow to
soften briefly before slicing and adding the mushrooms with a tablespoon of butter.
Crush in the garlic using a garlic press. Add the Worcestershire sauce, then the mustard and heat through for a minute. Turn
up the heat and tilt the pan away from you. Pour the brandy into the far end and allow it to ignite - be careful that the flame
that flares up doesn't singe your eyebrows! Once the alcohol has burnt off, swirl the juices around the pan.
Add the cream and allow the sauce to thicken before turning down the heat. Introduce the steaks back into the pan and
cook a little further depending on how well done you would like them. Chop the parsley and add half to the pan.  Serve
Immediately
