The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.<br>Steak Diane<br>4 x small sirloin steaks, approx 200gms.<br>3 shallots, peeled<br>4 ounces crimini mushrooms, cleaned (if crimini unavailable use button mushrooms instead)<br>1 tablespoon salted butter<br>1 garlic clove, peeled<br>1 -2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, to taste<br>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard<br>1/3 cup brandy or cognac<br>1 cup heavy cream<br>Small handful of flat-leaf parsley<br>Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, roll out the steaks to flatten and cut off any excess fat. Season the steaks on both sides<br>with salt and pepper. Heat a little olive oil in a skillet pan large enough to accommodate the 4 steaks in one layer. Quickly<br>sauté the steaks for up to a minute on each side then remove from the pan and set aside to rest.<br>To make the sauce for the steaks, heat some olive oil in a separate pan. Slice the shallots and add to the pan, allow to<br>soften briefly before slicing and adding the mushrooms with a tablespoon of butter.<br>Crush in the garlic using a garlic press. Add the Worcestershire sauce, then the mustard and heat through for a minute. Turn<br>up the heat and tilt the pan away from you. Pour the brandy into the far end and allow it to ignite - be careful that the flame<br>that flares up doesn't singe your eyebrows! Once the alcohol has burnt off, swirl the juices around the pan.<br>Add the cream and allow the sauce to thicken before turning down the heat. Introduce the steaks back into the pan and<br>cook a little further depending on how well done you would like them. Chop the parsley and add half to the pan.  Serve<br>Immediately
