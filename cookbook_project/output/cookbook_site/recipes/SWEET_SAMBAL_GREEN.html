INGREDIENTS
400 grams trimmed green beans
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger
1 tablespoon grated palm sugar
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
2 tablespoons Sambal Oelek
100 grams peanuts, roasted & salted
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Heat a wok or large skillet over medium high heat
Step 2:  Add 1 Tbsp oil to the wok.   Add the ginger and garlic 
to the pan, and stir around for a few seconds.
Step 3:   Add the green beans and cook, stirring, for about 3 
minutes or until the green beans are crisp, tender and bright 
green. The skin will also start to blister, which is what we 
want.
Step 4:   Add the soy sauce, chili paste, palm sugar, and 
sesame oil, and stir fry until the green beans are coated, and 
the sauce starts to look sticky.   Add a few drops of water if 
necessary
Step 5:   Toss in the chopped peanuts and toss for another 
few seconds until they get coated in the sauce too.
