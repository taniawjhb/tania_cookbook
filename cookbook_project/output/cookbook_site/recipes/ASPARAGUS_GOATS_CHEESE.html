ASPARAGUS & GOATS CHEESE 
GALETTE
1 1/4 cup unbleached white flour 
1/4 teaspoon salt
8 Tablespoons frozen unsalted butter cut into 
small pieces
1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt 
1/4 cup ice cold water
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1/2 cup goat cheese softened
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese 
1/4 cup grated mozzarella
1 Tablespoon olive oil plus 1 teaspoon
1 clove garlic minced
1 pound asparagus washed and trimmed
1 egg yolk
1 teaspoon water
To prepare crust, combine flour and salt in the bowl of a food 
processor. Pulse twice to combine. Add butter and pulse until 
mixture resembles coarse meal. Transfer mixture to a large bowl.
In a smaller bowl, whisk together yogurt, water, and lemon juice. 
Pour over flour mixture and use hands or a wooden spoon to 
form dough into a ball. Wrap in plastic and store in freezer for 20 
minutes.
To prepare filling, whisk together olive oil and garlic clove in a 
small bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the three cheeses and 
stir in one teaspoon of olive oil mixture. Refrigerate until ready for 
use.
To assemble galette, preheat oven to 200C. Line a baking sheet 
with parchment paper and set aside.
On a well floured surface, roll the chilled dough into a 12-inch 
circle, trimming edges until smooth. Transfer dough to lined 
baking sheet.
Leaving a 2-inch border, spread the cheese mixture 
evenly over dough. Arrange asparagus over the cheese then 
drizzle remaining olive oil mixture over the top. Fold over the 
edges of dough, pleating to make it fit.
Whisk together egg yolk and water. Brush over the crust 
and bake for 30 minutes or until cheese is puffed, asparagus is 
tender, and crust is golden brown..
