Green Tea & Coconut Cake
5 eggs separated
1 cup brown sugar, or 3/4 cup white sugar, OR 2/3 cup
agave nectar (sugar substitute)
pinch sea salt
1/2 cup
coconut oil OR canola oil
1/3 cup coconut milk
1 tsp. real vanilla extract
2 tsp. baking powder
1 cup white flour, OR light spelt flour, OR gluten-free cake flour
3 tsp.
green tea powder, such as Japanese "macha" (look for this at health food or Japanese import stores, or
follow the link to order online)
1 tsp. or more icing sugar
Preheat oven to 175C degrees. Prepare an angel food cake pan (or a 9-inch cake pan), either by
greasing it well, or lining it with parchment paper.
Crack eggs into 2 separate mixing bowls, with the egg whites in one bowl and the yolks in another.
Beat the egg whites until stiff, and set aside. (I use an electric hand mixer.)
Add the salt and sugar (or sugar substitute) to the yolks and stir well until smooth.
Add the coconut milk, oil, and vanilla to the yolks, and beat until mixed in (or stir it well).
In a 3rd bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and green tea powder. Now add (or sift) this into
the yolk mixture. Stir well or beat to incorporate. Note: the batter will turn green from the green tea - this
is the effect you want.
Now fold in the egg whites, stirring and mixing by hand and just until egg whites have dissolved into
the batter (do not overmix).
Pour the batter into the prepared pan and place in the oven for 25 to 35 minutes (depending on your
oven). Check the cake after 25 minutes by inserting a fork into the center of the cake. If it comes out
clean, it's done. (Note: the center should form a peak - if it is concave, your cake isn't nearly finished).
Decorate the cake with a sifting of icing sugar.  Add toasted coconut or some blueberries and mint, as
shown, for extra health benefits. Serve warm or at room temperature and enjoy
