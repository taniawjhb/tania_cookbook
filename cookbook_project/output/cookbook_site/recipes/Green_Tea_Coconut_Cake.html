Green Tea & Coconut Cake<br>5 eggs separated<br>1 cup brown sugar, or 3/4 cup white sugar, OR 2/3 cup<br>agave nectar (sugar substitute)<br>pinch sea salt<br>1/2 cup<br>coconut oil OR canola oil<br>1/3 cup coconut milk<br>1 tsp. real vanilla extract<br>2 tsp. baking powder<br>1 cup white flour, OR light spelt flour, OR gluten-free cake flour<br>3 tsp.<br>green tea powder, such as Japanese "macha" (look for this at health food or Japanese import stores, or<br>follow the link to order online)<br>1 tsp. or more icing sugar<br>Preheat oven to 175C degrees. Prepare an angel food cake pan (or a 9-inch cake pan), either by<br>greasing it well, or lining it with parchment paper.<br>Crack eggs into 2 separate mixing bowls, with the egg whites in one bowl and the yolks in another.<br>Beat the egg whites until stiff, and set aside. (I use an electric hand mixer.)<br>Add the salt and sugar (or sugar substitute) to the yolks and stir well until smooth.<br>Add the coconut milk, oil, and vanilla to the yolks, and beat until mixed in (or stir it well).<br>In a 3rd bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and green tea powder. Now add (or sift) this into<br>the yolk mixture. Stir well or beat to incorporate. Note: the batter will turn green from the green tea - this<br>is the effect you want.<br>Now fold in the egg whites, stirring and mixing by hand and just until egg whites have dissolved into<br>the batter (do not overmix).<br>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and place in the oven for 25 to 35 minutes (depending on your<br>oven). Check the cake after 25 minutes by inserting a fork into the center of the cake. If it comes out<br>clean, it's done. (Note: the center should form a peak - if it is concave, your cake isn't nearly finished).<br>Decorate the cake with a sifting of icing sugar.  Add toasted coconut or some blueberries and mint, as<br>shown, for extra health benefits. Serve warm or at room temperature and enjoy<br>The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.
