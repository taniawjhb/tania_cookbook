QUICK CREME BRULEE<br>500 ml cream<br>1 vanilla pod OR 1 tsp vanilla bean paste <br>5 egg yolks<br>50 g caster sugar<br>Caramel Topping<br>40 g caster sugar<br>Step 1:  If you are using a vanilla bean infuse <br>cream: Simmer uncovered over low heat for 10 <br>minutes. Remove from stove and set aside to <br>infuse for 1 hour with lid on (you can skip this <br>step if using paste or extract, just let it cool to <br>lukewarm). Remove vanilla pod. Skim off any <br>skin that has formed on the surface.<br>Preparation: Preheat oven to 130°C. Place 4 x <br>empty ramekins in a baking pan with high <br>enough sides that enough water can be <br>poured in to come halfway up ramekins.<br>Boil water: Boil a kettle of water.<br>Whisk egg yolks and sugar: Whisk yolks and <br>sugar until just well combined. Don't whisk too <br>much, as this can create bubbles.<br>Add cream: Pour cream into eggs and gently <br>stir to combine. Divide mixture between <br>ramekins with a soup ladle.<br>Water bath: Pour in enough boiling water so it <br>comes halfway up the sides of the ramekins. (If <br>you have too much water, ramekins will float <br>around – not good!)<br>Bake: Bake for 35 – 40 minutes, or until the <br>custard is set but there is still a slight wobble <br>when you GENTLY give the ramekin a little <br>shake.<br>Chill: Remove ramekins from water. Leave to <br>cool, then refrigerate for at least 6 hours and <br>preferably overnight (up to 3 days is OK).<br>Blow torch <br><br><h2>Method</h2>: Sprinkle 1/2 tsp sugar over <br>the surface of each crème brûlée. Use a blow <br>torch to melt and caramelise the sugar. Serve <br>immediately.
