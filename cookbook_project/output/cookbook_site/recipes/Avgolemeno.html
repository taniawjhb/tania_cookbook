Avgolemeno<br>Extra Virgin Olive Oil (I used Private Reserve Greek olive oil)<br>½ to 1 cup finely chopped carrots<br>½ to 1 cup finely chopped celery<br>½ to 1 cup finely chopped green onions<br>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped<br>8 cups low-sodium chicken broth<br>2 bay leaves<br>1 cup rice<br>Salt and pepper<br>2 cooked boneless chicken breast pieces, shredded ( about 6 to 8 oz store-bought rotisserie chicken will work)<br>½ cup freshly-squeezed lemon juice<br>2 large eggs<br>Fresh parsley for garnish (optional)<br>In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, heat 1 tbsp olive oil on medium-high. Add the carrots, celery and green onions, toss together to saute<br>briefly then stir in the garlic.<br>Add the chicken broth and bay leaves then raise the heat to high. Once the liquid has come to a rolling boil, add the rice, salt and pepper.<br>Turn the heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes or until the rice is tender. Now stir in the cooked chicken.<br>To prepare the egg-lemon sauce, in a medium bowl, whisk together the lemon juice and eggs. While whisking add 2 ladles-full of the<br>broth from the cooking pot (this helps temper the eggs). Once fully combined, add the sauce to the chicken soup and stir. Remove from the<br>heat immediately.<br>Garnish with fresh parsley, if you like. Serve hot with your favorite bread. Enjoy!<br>The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.
