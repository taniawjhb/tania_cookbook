Avgolemeno
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (I used Private Reserve Greek olive oil)
½ to 1 cup finely chopped carrots
½ to 1 cup finely chopped celery
½ to 1 cup finely chopped green onions
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
8 cups low-sodium chicken broth
2 bay leaves
1 cup rice
Salt and pepper
2 cooked boneless chicken breast pieces, shredded ( about 6 to 8 oz store-bought rotisserie chicken will work)
½ cup freshly-squeezed lemon juice
2 large eggs
Fresh parsley for garnish (optional)
In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, heat 1 tbsp olive oil on medium-high. Add the carrots, celery and green onions, toss together to saute
briefly then stir in the garlic.
Add the chicken broth and bay leaves then raise the heat to high. Once the liquid has come to a rolling boil, add the rice, salt and pepper.
Turn the heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes or until the rice is tender. Now stir in the cooked chicken.
To prepare the egg-lemon sauce, in a medium bowl, whisk together the lemon juice and eggs. While whisking add 2 ladles-full of the
broth from the cooking pot (this helps temper the eggs). Once fully combined, add the sauce to the chicken soup and stir. Remove from the
heat immediately.
Garnish with fresh parsley, if you like. Serve hot with your favorite bread. Enjoy!
