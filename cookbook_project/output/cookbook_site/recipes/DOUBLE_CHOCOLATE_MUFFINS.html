DOUBLE CHOCOLATE MUFFINS
iNGREDIENTS
1 1/2 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup cocoa powder
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup chocolate chips
1 cup milk
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/3 cup vegetable oil
Method:
Preheat your oven to 180C and prepare a 12-cup muffin tin
with paper liners.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder,
sugar, baking powder, and salt, along with the chocolate
chips, reserving a few chocolate chips for topping the muffins
(optional).
Into a large liquid measuring cup or bowl, add the milk, eggs,
vanilla and oil. Whisk together with a fork.
Add the liquid ingredients and mix everything together just
until no streaks of flour remain.
Divide the batter evenly between the 12 muffin cups and top
with the remaining chocolate chips (optional).
Bake at 180C for about 23-25 minutes, or until a toothpick
inserted into the centre of one of the muffins comes out
clean.
