STEAK AU POIVRE<br>STEAK WITH BLACK PEPPER<br><br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2><br>4 fillet steaks, 180gms each and no more <br>than 4cm thick<br>Coarse salt<br>2 tablespoons whole peppercorns<br>1 tablespoon unsalted butter<br>1 teaspoon olive oil<br>1/3 cup Cognac, plus 1 teaspoon<br>1 cup heavy cream<br><br><br><h2>Method</h2><br>1.  Remove the steaks from the refrigerator for at <br>least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour prior to cooking.  <br>Sprinkle all sides with salt.<br>2.  Coarsely crush the peppercorns with a mortar <br>and pestle, the bottom of a cast iron skillet, or using <br>a mallet and pie pan. Spread the peppercorns evenly <br>onto a plate. Press the fillets, on both sides, into the <br>pepper until it coats the surface. Set aside.<br>3.  In a medium skillet over medium heat, melt the <br>butter and olive oil. As soon as the butter and oil <br>begin to turn golden and smoke, gently place the <br>steaks in the pan. For medium-rare, cook for 4 <br>minutes on each side. Once done, remove the steaks <br>to a plate, tent with foil and set aside. Pour off the <br>excess fat but do not wipe or scrape the pan clean.<br>4.  Off of the heat, add 1/3 cup Cognac to the pan <br>and carefully ignite the alcohol with a long match or <br>firestick.  Gently shake pan until the flames die. <br>Return the pan to medium heat and add the cream. <br>Bring the mixture  to a boil and whisk until the sauce <br>coats the back of a spoon, approximately 5 to 6 <br>minutes. Add the teaspoon of Cognac and season, to <br>taste, with salt. Add the steaks back to the pan, <br>spoon the sauce over, and serve.
