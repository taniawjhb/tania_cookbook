If the<br>butter is too hard, you can melt it. *If you melt it, stick it in the refrigerator before you spread it on the dough.<br>Separate the dough into 3 even balls. Sprinkle with a little bit of flour. Roll out each ball into a circle, flipping and<br>stretching until the dough is super thin.<br>Spread a layer of filling on the dough. Cut into 8 slices, like a pizza. Separate each slice and roll tightly. *You need<br>to separate the slices so they don’t get covered in chocolate on the outside from the other slices. Place each<br>rugelach on a non-stick baking tray.<br>Brush with a beaten egg and bake for 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the glaze by adding the water to a<br>saucepan on medium heat. Then add the sugar and stir until the sugar melts. Simmer for 1 minute. When the<br>rugelach are done baking, scoop the glaze onto the rugelach while they are still hot.
