DUCK FAT ROASTED POTATOES<br>1kg potatoes, peeled and cut into pieces<br>170g duck fat<br>½ tbs salt<br>2 tbs polenta<br>Preheat your oven to 240ºC<br>Place the duck fat in a roasting tray & place in the oven to start<br>heating up. The secret to these potatoes is to get the duck fat<br>ferociously hot.<br>In a large pot, cover the potatoes with cold water, season well &<br>bring to the boil. Parboil the potatoes for no more than 10<br>minutes.  Drain the potatoes & return them to the pot<br>Place the polenta/semolina in the pot, cover tightly & give the<br>potatoes a ferocious shake to coat them evenly & smash up<br>their edges a bit (these are the parts that really crisp up nicely)<br>Carefully remove the tray from the oven & using a pair of tongs,<br>place the potatoes gently into the sizzling duck fat<br>Return the tray to the oven & roast the potatoes for 1 hour,<br>turning them throughout the cooking time so that they brown on<br>all sides<br>Remove from the trays, drain on some kitchen towel & serve<br>immediately. Golden, crusty, crunchy perfection
