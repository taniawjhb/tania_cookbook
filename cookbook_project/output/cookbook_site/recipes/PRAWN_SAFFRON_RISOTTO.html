PRAWN & SAFFRON RISOTTO<br>1kg prawns, shell on, deveined and cleaned <br>3tbsp butter<br>1/4 cup olive oil<br>2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped<br>1 glass white wine <br>Salt & pepper<br>8 cups prawn stock <br>1/4 cup olive oil<br>1 medium onion, diced<br>1 stick of celery, finely chopped<br>1 carrot, finely chopped <br>Large pinch of saffron<br>2 cups arborio rice<br>1 cup dry white wine<br>1 tablespoon flat leaf parsley, chopped <br>4 tablespoons cold butter<br>Salt and pepper<br>1.  In a large heavybased saucepan, add the butter and olive oil. <br>Place over a medium heat.  Once it is hot add the garlic and stir <br>quickly.  Almost immediately add the prawns.  Add them in a <br>single layer allowing them to colour, but NOT cook all the way <br>through.<br>2.  As the prawns are cooked remove and set aside.  Once all <br>the prawns have been cooked, remove their heads and shells. <br>Reserve all the juices and shells.<br>3.  Return the pan to the heat, add half a roughly chopped <br>onion, a small bunch of fresh celery leaf and stir to coat.<br>4.  Once the onion starts to soften add the white wine and <br>deglaze the pan.  Now add back all the prawn shells and <br>reserved juices.<br>5.  Add 2litres of a good quality light vegetable stock and <br>simmer for 20-minutes, skimming off any foam that surfaces.<br>6.  Strain and use immediately, or allow to cool and freeze<br>1.  Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; add <br>onion, carrot and celery and season with salt and pepper<br>2.  Add the rice and stir to coat with the oil; season with salt and <br>pepper and cook until slightly translucent.<br>6.  The rice should be hot and sizzling, you should stir carefully to <br>ensure it does not stick.<br>7 .  Add wine to the hot rice, the liquid should hiss and be quickly <br>absorbed.  Stir gently until almost all the liquid has cooked off. <br>Add hot stock and broth mixture, a ladleful at a time, completely <br>stirring in the liquid each time.  Remember at this stage you are <br>trying to coax the starches out the rice by gently and continuosly <br>stirring.<br>8.  Keep adding broth as needed so there is always a 1/2cm <br>liquid layer over the rice.<br>9.  After about 8 minutes add add the saffron which has been <br>soaked in 2 tbsp warm water<br>10. After 15 to 20 minutes, the rice should be close to al dente.<br>11.  At this stage add the reserved prawn meat, cut into bite size <br>hunks, and stir to combine well - the prawns will cook through in <br>the heat of the rice.<br>12.  Taste and adjust seasoning<br>13.  Now cover the pan, and allow it to stand for 2-3minutes.
