<h2>Ingredients</h2><br>500g roasted peanuts<br>Blended Paste<br>25g dried chillies, rehydrated in hot water <br>and chopped<br>1 onion, chopped<br>4-5 shallots, chopped<br>5 cloves garlic<br>1-inch ginger, chopped<br>1-inch galangal, chopped<br>2 stalks lemongrass, bruised and sliced<br>1 tsp shrimp paste<br>1/4 cup water, for easier blending<br>Peanut Sauce<br>1 cup vegetable oil, with extra on the side<br>4 cups water, with extra on the side<br>100g palm sugar, or to taste<br>1 tbsp salt, or to taste<br>1 cup coconut milk<br>2 tbsps tamarind paste, or to taste<br>1 tbsp dark sweet soy sauce<br>INSTRUCTIONS<br>Step 1:  Add peanuts to a blender or food processor. Give <br>them a rough pulse, so that you get chunks of peanuts in the <br>sauce. Once processed, remove and set to one side.<br>Blending the Aromatic Paste<br>1.  Soak the dried chillies with hot water for 5 minutes, or until <br>the chillies rehydrate and soften. <br>2.  Once rehydrated, drain and chop dried chillies to smaller <br>pieces for easier blending.<br>3.  Peel and roughly chop the onions and shallots, garlic, <br>ginger and galangal.<br>4.  Remove the hard outer layer of lemongrass, and the top <br>and bottom root part. Bruise lemongrass with the back of the <br>knife, or a pestle to release fragrance. Slice at a diagonal.<br>5.  Add all of the prepped ingredients in the blender. Add <br>about 1/4 cup of water, for easier blending. Turn the blender <br>on and blitz to a smooth paste.<br>Making the Peanut Sauce<br>Step 1:  Add plenty of oil to the wok, and heat over low to <br>medium heat. Once hot, add the blended paste.<br>Step 2:  Continuously stir fry until the paste is fragrant and <br>slightly dries down. The paste should have emulsified and <br>released oil. If the paste is too dry before oil is released, add <br>more oil. This ‘pecah minyak’ or oil splitting process can take <br>10 minutes or so. Once the dried chilli paste has cooked <br>down, add the blitzed peanuts and water. Stir to combine.<br>Step 3:  Add your blocks of palm sugar and salt to taste. Let <br>this to come to a boil, before turning the heat down and allow <br>to simmer for 15 minutes, or until the palm sugar blocks melt.<br>Step 4:  Once the palm sugar has melted, add coconut milk <br>and tamarind paste. If too much liquid has cooked off, add <br>more water. Add dark sweet soy sauce.<br>Step 5:  Let sauce come up to another boil. Taste test and <br>season accordingly with sugar and salt, if needed.  Once <br>you’re happy with the taste, satay sauce is done. Serve hot!<br>SATAY PEANUT SAUCE
