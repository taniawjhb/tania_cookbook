ROASTED TOMATO SOUP
1,3kg fresh tomatoes (mix of fresh heirlooms, cherry, vine and plum tomatoes)
6 cloves garlic, peeled
2 small yellow onions, sliced
Vine cherry tomatoes for garnish, optional
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 quart chicken stock
2 bay leaves
4 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup chopped fresh basil leaves, optional
3/4 cup heavy cream, optional
Preheat oven to 220C.
Wash, core and cut the tomatoes into halves. Spread the tomatoes, garlic cloves and onions onto a baking
tray. If using vine cherry tomatoes for garnish, add them as well, leaving them whole and on the vine. Drizzle
with 1/2 cup of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 20 to 30 minutes, or until caramelized.
Remove roasted tomatoes, garlic and onion from the oven and transfer to a large stock pot (set aside the
roasted vine tomatoes for later). Add 3/4 of the chicken stock, bay leaves, and butter. Bring to a boil, reduce
heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes or until liquid has reduced by a third.
Wash and dry basil leaves, if using, and add to the pot. Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until
smooth. Return soup to low heat, add cream and adjust consistency with remaining chicken stock, if
necessary. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Garnish in bowl with 3 or 4 roasted
vine cherry tomatoes and a splash of heavy cream.
