For the leek pie<br>12–15 phyllo sheets, thawed<br>800–900 g leeks, sliced <br>3–4 spring onions, finely chopped<br>1/2 a glass white wine<br>1 egg yolk<br>250ml milk or milk cream<br>150g feta cheese, crumbled<br>100g Graviera cheese, or hard yellow <br>cheese <br>salt and freshly ground pepper<br>olive oil or butter for brushing the pan<br>1 egg and 1 tsp water to brush the top<br>Instructions<br>Step 1:  It is important to thaw your phyllo completely by <br>putting it in the fridge the previous day. <br>Step 2:  Start by making the filling. Wash the leeks and trim <br>them, keeping only the white part and cut in slices about 2cm <br>wide<br>Step 3:  Heat a saucepan, add olive oil, the leeks and <br>scallions and season with salt and pepper. Sauté, whilst <br>stirring, until tender. Once the leeks are tender deglaze with <br>the white wine and wait for it to evaporate. Remove the pan <br>from the stove and allow the leeks to cool down.<br>Step 4:  In a bowl add 1 egg yolk and the milk cream and <br>whisk. Stir in the leeks mixture, feta cheese, graviera cheese, <br>season with pepper and blend to combine.<br>Step 5:  Brush a medium sized baking tray with olive oil and <br>lay one sheet of phyllo dough, allowing it to exceed the pan. <br>Brush the phyllo sheet with olive oil or melted butter and <br>continue with 5-6 more phyllo sheets (brushing each one with <br>olive oil or melted butter). Tip in the filling and even out using <br>a spatula. With a knife trim some of the excessive phyllo, and <br>fold the excess phyllo sheets flaps over the mixture. Add 5-6 <br>more phyllo sheets, making sure to oil or butter each one, <br>before adding the other. Trim some of the excessive phyllo <br>and roll the rest on the edges.<br>Step 6:  In a bowl whisk the egg and the water, brush the top <br>of the leek pie and carefully score into pieces. Bake in <br>preheated oven at 180C for about 50 minutes, until nicely <br>coloured. Allow to cool slightly and serve.<br>PRASOPITA
