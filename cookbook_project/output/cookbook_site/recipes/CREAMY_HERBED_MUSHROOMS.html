CREAMY HERBED MUSHROOMS<br>12 large free range eggs<br>100ml cream<br>40gms butter<br>Large knob of butter<br>2 tbsp olive oil<br>2 punnets portabellini mushrooms<br>2 clove garlic, finely chopped<br>pinch of dry red chili<br>1 red onion<br>2 tsp finely chopped parsley<br>50ml brandy/cognac<br>100ml cream<br>In a large frying pan add the butter and olive oil. Once it is hot add the finely chopped red onion, cook until<br>tender. Now add the finely minced garlic and the dry red chili. Add the mushrooms, stirring occasionally, if<br>needed add a little extra olive oil or butter. Add salt and pepper.<br>Once the mushrooms have reduced down and cooked through add the brandy, being careful in case the flame<br>catches.<br>Cook off the brandy, then add the cream, and cold butter and the fresh parsley. Stir well, check and adjust<br>seasoning. Serve warm over the scrambled eggs.<br>To make the scrambled eggs, scramble the eggs, cream with some salt and pepper. In a non stick frying pan,<br>add the butter and over a medium heat allow it to melt. Once the butter has almost all melted, add the well<br>scrambled eggs. To create creamy scrambled eggs don’t be tempted to overwork the mixture. Allow it to set<br>slightly at the bottom of the pan before moving the mixture in long movements across the whole pan. You want<br>to create large creamy mounds of eggs. When the eggs are about 80% cooked through switch off the heat.<br>Gently fold the mixture until the eggs are just set but not dry.<br>Serve the eggs onto a warmed platter and top with the mushrooms and an extra scatter of herbs and some<br>parmesan shavings.<br>Secret Sunday Brunch in partnership with Pierre Jourdan<br>#anytimebubbly
