CREAMY HERBED MUSHROOMS
12 large free range eggs
100ml cream
40gms butter
Large knob of butter
2 tbsp olive oil
2 punnets portabellini mushrooms
2 clove garlic, finely chopped
pinch of dry red chili
1 red onion
2 tsp finely chopped parsley
50ml brandy/cognac
100ml cream
In a large frying pan add the butter and olive oil. Once it is hot add the finely chopped red onion, cook until
tender. Now add the finely minced garlic and the dry red chili. Add the mushrooms, stirring occasionally, if
needed add a little extra olive oil or butter. Add salt and pepper.
Once the mushrooms have reduced down and cooked through add the brandy, being careful in case the flame
catches.
Cook off the brandy, then add the cream, and cold butter and the fresh parsley. Stir well, check and adjust
seasoning. Serve warm over the scrambled eggs.
To make the scrambled eggs, scramble the eggs, cream with some salt and pepper. In a non stick frying pan,
add the butter and over a medium heat allow it to melt. Once the butter has almost all melted, add the well
scrambled eggs. To create creamy scrambled eggs don’t be tempted to overwork the mixture. Allow it to set
slightly at the bottom of the pan before moving the mixture in long movements across the whole pan. You want
to create large creamy mounds of eggs. When the eggs are about 80% cooked through switch off the heat.
Gently fold the mixture until the eggs are just set but not dry.
Serve the eggs onto a warmed platter and top with the mushrooms and an extra scatter of herbs and some
parmesan shavings.
