APRICOT & PISTACHIO <br>COUSCOUS<br><br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2><br>1/2 cup red onion, chopped<br>1/4 cup lemon juice<br>1 300g box couscous, about 1 1/3 cups<br>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided<br>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste<br>1/2 cup shelled raw pistachios (optional)<br>10 dried apricots, chopped<br>1/3 cup parsley, chopped<br>Optional 2 teaspoons harissa paste<br><br><br><h2>Method</h2><br>1. Soak chopped onion in lemon juice:<br>Place the chopped onion in a small bowl. Pour the <br>lemon juice over the onions, set aside and let the <br>onions soak in the lemon juice.<br>2.  Toast pistachios:  Toast the pistachios in a <br>small pan on medium-high heat until lightly browned <br>and fragrant. (Take care when toasting nuts, they <br>can burn quickly if you don't pay attention!) Remove <br>from heat and place into a small bowl to cool.<br>3.  Cook the couscous:  Put 2 cups of water in a <br>medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Add one <br>tablespoon of olive oil and one teaspoon of salt to <br>the water. Once the salt dissolves, stir in the <br>couscous, turn off the heat and cover the pot. Move <br>the pot off the hot burner and let the couscous <br>steam, covered, for 5 to 6 minutes.<br>4.  Combine ingredients to make salad:  Scoop <br>out the couscous into a large bowl and fluff with a <br>fork. Stir in the harissa, if using. Stir in the <br>pistachios, chopped apricots and parsley. Stir in the <br>red onion and lemon juice. Add one more tablespoon <br>of olive oil, stir well and add salt to taste. Serve <br>warm or at room temperature.
