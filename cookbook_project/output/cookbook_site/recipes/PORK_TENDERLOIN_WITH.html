PORK TENDERLOIN WITH<br>APPLES & SAGE<br>700gms boneless pork tenderloin<br>1-2 tbsp olive oil<br>2 tsp chopped sage<br>salt and pepper<br>1 Gala apple core removed and cut into chunks<br>with the skin on<br>1/2 a yellow onion diced<br>2 tbsp balsamic vinegar<br>1 cup apple jam<br>Preheat the oven to 180C. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a cast-iron<br>skillet over high heat. Carefully place the pork tenderloin into the pan<br>and cook each side for approximately 3 to 4 minutes, or until each side<br>is nicely browned.<br>Lower the heat to medium-low. Remove the tenderloin from the pan,<br>temporarily placing it on a plate. Add a generous pinch of salt to both<br>sides of the tenderloin, as well as a small pinch of freshly ground<br>pepper; set aside.<br>To the pan, add another tablespoon of oil (if needed). Add the apple<br>chunks and diced onion. Give everything a stir and sauté for a couple<br>of minutes until the onions turn translucent. Pour in 1 tablespoon of<br>balsamic vinegar and again stir everything together. Remove the skillet<br>from the heat.<br>Gently push aside the apple chunks and onions to clear a space in the<br>middle of the pan for the pork tenderloin. Transfer the tenderloin back<br>into the pan, pouring its residual juices on the plate in as well.<br>Warm the apple jam for 30 seconds in the microwave, then add a<br>tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to it. Stir in the vinegar until its<br>incorporated, then smear the jam all over the pork tenderloin. Sprinkle<br>the chopped sage over the entire contents of the pan.<br>Cover the skillet with a sheet of foil, then bake the tenderloin for 20<br>minutes, stopping to remove the sheet of foil. Bake for another 10 to 20<br>minutes, until it registers at least 165°F on a meat thermometer. Once<br>it's done baking, let the tenderloin rest for at least 5 minutes before<br>slicing on the diagonal and serving.
