<pre>
350 grams spinach
1 medium tomato
5 large garlic cloves divided, 3 whole and 2
finely chopped
1 inch ginger
1 green chili or more to taste
1 tablespoon oil
1 large onion finely chopped
1/2 cup water or as needed
3/4-1 teaspoon garam masala
1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder
1/4 teaspoon red chili powder or to taste
salt to taste
2-3 tablespoons heavy cream or adjust to
taste
225 grams paneer cut into cubes
1/2 tablespoon kasuri methi crushed, dried
fenugreek leaves
lemon juice to taste
To a pot of boiling water, add little salt and then spinach leaves
to it. Blanch the spinach leaves for 2 to 3 minutes until wilted.
Take them out and put them in ice cold water. This helps the
leaves in retaining their green color.
To a blender, add the blanched spinach along with tomato, 3
cloves of garlic, ginger and green chili. Puree to a smooth paste
and set aside.
Heat a pan on medium heat. Once hot, add the oil and then
add the remaining 2 cloves of chopped garlic. Sauté for few
minutes until it starts changing color.
Then add the chopped onions. Cook the onion for 2 to 3 minutes
until soft and translucent.
Add in the prepared spinach puree and mix. Also add around
1/2 cup water at the point.
Cover the pan and let it cook for 10 minutes on medium heat.
The spinach will bubble a lot. Stir at regular intervals to avoid
sticking at the bottom.
Once the spinach is cooked, add the garam masala, turmeric
powder, red chilli powder and salt. Mix and cook for 1 minute.
You may also add 1/2 teaspoon of sugar at this point if you like.
Then add the heavy cream and mix.
Stir in the paneer and mix. Let the curry simmer for 3 to 4
minutes. Switch off the flame, add lemon juice and kasuri methi
and mix.
Serve palak paneer hot with naan or roti or rice.
