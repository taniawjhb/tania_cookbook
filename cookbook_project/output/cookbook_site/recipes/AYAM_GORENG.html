INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Toast spices: Toast spices in a small skillet over 
medium heat (no oil) for 2 minutes or until the spices smell 
fragrant. Transfer seeds into blender, small food processor OR 
into a tall jug that fits a stick blender.
Step 2:  Add remaining Curry Paste ingredients and blend until 
smooth.  Pour Curry Paste over chicken in a ziplock bag or 
bowl. Toss to coat, then marinate for 24 hours in the fridge, up 
to 48 hours.
Step 3:  Dechill chicken: Remove chicken from fridge 30 
minutes prior to cooking and transfer into a bowl (most 
marinade should be stuck to chicken).
Step 4:  Cornflour coating: Add cornflour to chicken and toss to 
coat – it will thicken the paste, this is what makes the craggy 
coating.
Step 5:  Pour oil into a wide, heavy based pot to a depth of 6 
cm. Heat over medium high heat to 180°C – maintain temp 
as best you can 
Step 6:  Carefully place 3 pieces of chicken in, do not touch for 
2 min (to let crust adhere). Oil temperature should drop to 
150°C/300°C – increase heat if needed.
Step 7:  Fry for 8 minutes (wings for 5 minutes), or until deep 
golden brown and internal temperature at thickest part is 
cooked through.
Keep warm: Place cooked chicken onto rack and keep warm 
in oven. Cook remaining chicken.
Serve immediately, sprinkled with coriander and garlic-chilli 
garnish, if using.
GARNISH:
Heat 3 tbsp oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add garlic 
and chilli, cook until garlic is starting to go light golden. Then 
add green onion and cook until garlic is golden. Drain on 
paper towels, sprinkle with salt. Cool then sprinkle on chicken.
