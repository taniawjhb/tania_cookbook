BANANA FRITTERS
Ingredients:
100g All-Purpose Flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
pinch of salt
150 ml water
1 Tablespoon vegetable oil
1 Banana
Sugar and/or shredded coconut for coating
In a bowl, add the flour, baking powder, and salt.
Add the water and oil and combine with a hand whisk. The consistency should be thick, like heavy cream and
be able to coat a spoon. If it is too thick, add a drop more water, too thin, add a little more flour. Set aside.
Heat a pan with vegetable oil until it reaches 180 C or 350 F. Make sure you do not overfill the pan with oil. I use
a small saucepan and cook in batches, filling the pan 1/3rd deep with cooking oil.
Whilst the oil is heating up, peel the banana, cut in half and then slice lengthways in half so you have 4 pieces.
Dip each piece in the batter so it is fully coated and carefully place in the pan, cooking both sides until golden
brown. ** To tell if the oil is hot enough, drop a tiny bit of batter, the size of a pea into the oil. If it sizzles and floats
to the top immediately, the oil is hot enough.
Place the fritters on some kitchen paper then dip into a bowl with sugar and coconut if using, to coat.
