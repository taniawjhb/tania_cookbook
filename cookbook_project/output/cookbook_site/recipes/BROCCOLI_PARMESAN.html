BROCCOLI & PARMESAN<br>FRITTATA<br>2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br>1/2 cup sliced red onions<br>1/2 teaspoon salt<br>225gms broccoli, ends cut off, cut into bite size pieces<br>8 large eggs<br>3/4 cup ricotta cheese (you can use cottage cheese if you prefer)<br>1 tbsp minced fresh chives<br>1/4 teaspoon dried tarragon<br>1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese<br>Heat butter into a 10-inch oven-proof frying pan over medium heat. Add shallots and cook, stirring occasionally,<br>until they soften and turn translucent, about 3 minutes. Add broccoli and cook for an additional 3 minutes.<br>Beat the eggs and ricotta cheese together, stir in the chives and tarragon. Pour the egg mixture into the pan and<br>cook until almost set, but still runny on top, about 4 to 5 minutes. While cooking, pre-heat oven broiler.<br>Sprinkle parmesan cheese over the eggs and put in oven to bake until cheese is melted and browned, and the<br>center is set, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove pan from oven with oven mitts and slide frittata onto a serving plate.<br>Cut into wedges. (Be very careful with the hot pan handle! I usually ice down the handle of any long handled<br>pan I take out of the oven so that no one mistakenly tries to pick up the pan by the hot handle.)<br>Secret Sunday Brunch in partnership with Pierre Jourdan<br>#anytimebubbly
