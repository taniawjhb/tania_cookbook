Panzanella Salad
4 large red capsicum
4 slices sourdough bread
1/3 cup (80ml) extra virgin olive oil
1 clove garlic, peeled
250g cherry tomatoes, halved
100g pitted kalamata olives, halved
1/2 cup torn basil leaves
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar*
Preheat a barbecue or char-grill over medium heat. Cook capsicum, turning, for 10-15 minutes or until skins
blacken and blister. Set aside to cool.
Brush bread with 1 tablespoon oil, then cook for 30 seconds each side or until lightly charred. Rub bread all over
with peeled garlic clove. Tear into bite-sized pieces.
Place in a large bowl.
Peel capsicum over a bowl to save juice. Discard skins then cut capsicum in half, discarding seeds. Cut capsicum
into 3cm pieces and add to bread pieces together with tomatoes, olives and basil. Season to taste with salt and
pepper. Toss gently to combine.
Whisk remaining oil, vinegar and capsicum juice together. Season to taste, then pour dressing over salad. Toss
gently to combine. Serve.
