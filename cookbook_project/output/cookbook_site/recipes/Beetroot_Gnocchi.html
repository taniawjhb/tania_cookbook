1 kg floury potatoes, boiled
400g roasted beetroot, peeled and roughly chopped
300g plain flour

Gently mix the beetroot puree into the potatoes, and make a well from the mixture. Then add beaten egg as 
well as pinch of salt, and half the flour to the mixture.
Gently start folding the mixture into itself (do NOT OVERWORK), gradually adding the balance of the flour

intervls and transfer gnocchi to a floured baking tray. To cook - add to rapidly boiling salted water. Remove 
when floating and trasfer to blue cheese sauce.
In a frying pan, over medium heat, add the pancetta and fry until it has rendered and started to release its
