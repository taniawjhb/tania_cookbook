<pre>
Pâté de foie de poulet
225gms chicken livers, well-trimmed
1/2 small onion, thinly sliced
1 small garlic clove, smashed and peeled
1 bay leaf
1/4 teaspoon thyme leaves
fine salt
120ml light chicken stock
175gms unsalted butter, at room temperature
2 teaspoons Cognac or Scotch whisky
Freshly ground pepper
In a medium saucepan, combine the chicken livers, onion, garlic, bay leaf, thyme and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.
Add the stock/water and bring to a simmer.
Cover, reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the livers are barely pink inside, about 3
minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.
Discard the bay leaf. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the livers, onion and garlic to a food processor; process
until coarsely pureed. With the machine on, add the butter, 2 tablespoons at a time, until incorporated.
Add the Cognac, season with salt and pepper and process until completely smooth. Scrape the pâté into 2
or 3 large ramekins. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the pâté and refrigerate until
firm.
