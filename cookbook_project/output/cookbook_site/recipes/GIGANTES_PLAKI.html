GIGANTES PLAKI
Extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 large onion, roughly chopped
1 large carrot, peeled and roughly chopped
1 celery stalk, roughly chopped
2 large garlic cloves, minced
Salt
1 can diced tomatoes, with juices
6 Tablespoons water
1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley, plus more 
for garnish
1/2 Tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
3/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 dried bay leaf
1 450g can butter beans, drained and rinsed 
(or the largest beans you can find)
Creamy feta cheese, crumbled
Rustic bread, for serving
Step 1:  Preheat oven: Position a rack in the 
center of the oven and preheat the oven to 
190C.
Step 2:  Saute the vegetables: In a large oven-
safe skillet set over medium-high heat, add 
1/8 cup olive oil. Once the oil shimmers, add 
the onion, carrot, celery, and garlic. Season with 
a pinch of salt (about 1/4 teaspoon). Cook, 
stirring frequently, until the vegetables soften, 5-
7 minutes.
Step 3:  Add the tomatoes and spices: Add the 
tomatoes with their juices and the water. 
Season with another pinch of salt (about 1/4 
teaspoon). Add the parsley, thyme, oregano, 
red pepper flakes, black pepper, cinnamon, 
and bay leaf.
Step 4:  Add the beans: Stir in the beans and 
cook for 5 minutes over high heat. At this point, 
taste and adjust the seasoning to your liking, 
then transfer the mixture to the oven and bake 
until thickened and the top layer turns a light 
golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.
Finish and serve: Remove and discard the bay 
leaf. Finish the dish with a drizzle of olive oil, a 
pinch of parsley, and a good sprinkle of feta. 
Serve with rustic bread.
