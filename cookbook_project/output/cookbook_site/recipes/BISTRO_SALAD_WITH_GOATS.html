BISTRO SALAD WITH GOATS
CHEESE CROUTES
240gms goat cheese log (fresh chèvre-
style goat cheese)
1/2 cup panko or bread crumbs (chilled)
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
6 cups lettuce (tender lettuces such as
spring mix, butter lettuce, or oak leaf
lettuce)
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon good quality red wine
vinegar
1/4 teaspoon ground mustard
1 dash fine sea salt
1 dash freshly ground
black pepper
Cut the goat cheese into 8 to 10 disks. Put the panko or
bread crumbs into a shallow bowl. If you will be baking the goat
cheese croutes, mix the vegetable oil in with the panko.
Heat the oven to 180C if you will be baking the goat cheese
croutes.
For either preparation, press the goat cheese disks into
the panko. Flip the disks to make sure both sides are completely
covered and roll the edges through the panko as well. Set the
coated goat cheese on a baking sheet or platter. Place the
platter in the freezer for 15 to 30 minutes. This allows the croutes
to set prior to cooking.
While the goat cheese sets, tear the lettuce into bite-size
pieces, wash and dry the lettuce, and set aside. If you are using
herbs in addition to lettuce, wash, dry, and prepare them for the
salad.
In a large salad bowl, whisk together the olive oil,
vinegar, and mustard. Add salt and pepper to taste and add the
clean lettuce to the bowl.
If cooking on the stove, heat the vegetable oil in a large
frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the goat cheese rounds.
Cook, without disturbing, until they're brown on one side. Flip
them over and cook until they're brown on the second side.
Remove them from the heat and drain them on a paper towel-
lined plate.
Toss the salad gently to coat the lettuce thoroughly with
the dressing. Divide the salad between four salad plates. Top
each salad with 2 or 3 goat cheese croutes and serve
immediately.
