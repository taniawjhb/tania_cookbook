BISTRO SALAD WITH GOATS<br>CHEESE CROUTES<br>240gms goat cheese log (fresh chèvre-<br>style goat cheese)<br>1/2 cup panko or bread crumbs (chilled)<br>1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br>6 cups lettuce (tender lettuces such as<br>spring mix, butter lettuce, or oak leaf<br>lettuce)<br>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil<br>1 tablespoon good quality red wine<br>vinegar<br>1/4 teaspoon ground mustard<br>1 dash fine sea salt<br>1 dash freshly ground<br>black pepper<br>Cut the goat cheese into 8 to 10 disks. Put the panko or<br>bread crumbs into a shallow bowl. If you will be baking the goat<br>cheese croutes, mix the vegetable oil in with the panko.<br>Heat the oven to 180C if you will be baking the goat cheese<br>croutes.<br>For either preparation, press the goat cheese disks into<br>the panko. Flip the disks to make sure both sides are completely<br>covered and roll the edges through the panko as well. Set the<br>coated goat cheese on a baking sheet or platter. Place the<br>platter in the freezer for 15 to 30 minutes. This allows the croutes<br>to set prior to cooking.<br>While the goat cheese sets, tear the lettuce into bite-size<br>pieces, wash and dry the lettuce, and set aside. If you are using<br>herbs in addition to lettuce, wash, dry, and prepare them for the<br>salad.<br>In a large salad bowl, whisk together the olive oil,<br>vinegar, and mustard. Add salt and pepper to taste and add the<br>clean lettuce to the bowl.<br>If cooking on the stove, heat the vegetable oil in a large<br>frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the goat cheese rounds.<br>Cook, without disturbing, until they're brown on one side. Flip<br>them over and cook until they're brown on the second side.<br>Remove them from the heat and drain them on a paper towel-<br>lined plate.<br>Toss the salad gently to coat the lettuce thoroughly with<br>the dressing. Divide the salad between four salad plates. Top<br>each salad with 2 or 3 goat cheese croutes and serve<br>immediately.
