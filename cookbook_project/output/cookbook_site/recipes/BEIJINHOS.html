BEIJINHOS<br><br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2><br>1 can of sweet condesned milk <br>1 cup of unsweetened, shredded coconut<br>1 tablespoon of butter plus a little more for <br>your hands<br>1/4 cup of heavy cream<br>16 whole cloves for decorating optional<br><br><br><h2>Method</h2><br>1. Add the condensed milk, the butter, and the cream to a <br>medium sauce pan and place it over medium heat until the <br>butter melts.<br>2.  After the butter has melted, add half of the shredded <br>coconut (1/2 cup) to the pan and stir.<br>3.  Continue to cook over medium heat, for approximately 10 <br>mins, stirring repeatedly, scraping the sides and the bottom <br>of the pan with a spatula to avoid burning.<br>4.  The beijinho is ready when you scrape the bottom of the <br>pan, and the mixture takes 2-3 seconds to come back to its <br>place, or when the mixture reaches 99-104C – You can use <br>a candy thermometer, or just a regular food thermometer to <br>check.<br>5.  Pour the hot coconut mixture into a dish, or plate, cover <br>with plastic wrap to contact and let it cool – about 2 hours.<br>6.  Meanwhile, pour the remaining shredded coconut in a <br>deep plate or bowl.<br>9.  When the beijinho mixture has cooled, butter your hands, <br>and scoop 1/2 Tbsp to Tbsp portions and roll little balls.<br>10.  Roll the little balls in the shredded coconut, and insert a <br>whole clove to each little coconut ball to decorate, if desired.<br>11.  Keep them in a cool place or in the refrigerator until <br>serving time.
