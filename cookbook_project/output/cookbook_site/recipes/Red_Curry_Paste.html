Red Curry Paste
Fiery, and f lavourful - the basis of many great dishes
3 dried red chillies 3 small red chillies
1 slice galangal/ ginger (or both) 2/3 of a stalk of lemon grass
peel of 2 limes (remove and use the peel only, avoid the bitter white pith) 
1.5 shallots/small red onions
2 clove garlic
1 slice of turmeric/ 1 tsp dry turmeric 1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp shrimp paste
Start by finely chopping all the ingredients, as much as possible.  Then add them to a heavy stone 
mortar and grind until a smooth paste is formed and all the aromas have been released.
Curry pastes can be stored in the fridge in a clean container for 7-10 days - but they are best fresh.
