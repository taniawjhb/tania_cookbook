The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.<br>Asparagus & Pancetta Risotto<br>8 cups vegetable stock<br>2tbsp olive oil<br>1 medium onion, diced<br>1 stick of celery, finely chopped<br>1 carrot, finely chopped<br>200gms, diced pancetta<br>2 cups arborio rice<br>1 cup white wine<br>1 tablespoon flat leaf parsley, chopped<br>4 tablespoons cold butter<br>200gms asparagus<br>150gms grated pecorino<br>Salt and pepper<br>1.  Heat the oil in a large saucepan.  Now add the diced pancetta.  Fry until golden and crispy.<br>2.  Remove half the pancetta and reserve for later.  Add onion, carrot and celery and season with salt and pepper<br>4.  Add the rice and stir to coat with pork fat and oil; cook until rice is slightly translucent.<br>5.  The rice should be hot and sizzling, you should stir carefully to ensure it does not stick.<br>6.  Add wine to the hot rice, the liquid should hiss and be quickly absorbed.  Stir gently until almost all the liquid has cooked off. Add hot<br>stock mixture, a ladleful at a time, stirring in the liquid each time.<br>7.  Remember at this stage you are trying to coax the starches out the rice by gently and continuously stirring.  After about 10-minutes add<br>the reserved asparagus trimmings.<br>8.  Keep adding stock  as needed so there is always a 1/2cm liquid layer over the rice.<br>9.  After 15 to 20 minutes, the rice should be close to al dente.<br>10.  At this stage add the reserved pancetta, asparagus and asparagus puree and cold butter and the finely grated cheese.<br>11.  Taste and adjust seasoning<br>12.  Now cover the pan, and allow it to stand for 2-3 minutes.<br>1.  Bring your vegetable stock to the boil then blanche the asparagus spears briefly in it.  Remove and set aside.<br>2.  Trim the bottom 1cm from the asparagus and set aside to use half way through the cooking of the risotto<br>3.  Now cut the remaining asparagus in half, the tips will be added at the very end of cooking the risotto.<br>4.  To make the asparagus puree, blend the middle third of the asparagus spears with a few tablespoons of stock in a small processor<br>until completely smooth, reserve.
