Then add the rice <br>and fry it until it is sizzling.  Then add the hot broth slowly, stirring frequently. The rice should be done in about 20 <br>min. When the rice is ready, mix in half the parmesan, and then spread the rice out in a flat baking tray to cool.<br>In a heavy based frying pan add over medium high heat, fry the little cubes of chorizo until crispy.<br>Mix the chopped smoked cheese and chorizo once it has cooled slightly, add the rest of the parmesan, the <br>chopped parsley, 1 egg, nutmeg, salt and pepper (If the mixture is a little wet add some more parmesan). With <br>slightly damp hands, take a handful of rice in one hand, and a pinch of stuffing with the other. Push the stuffing <br>into the middle of the rice. Squeeze the rice all around the stuffing and mould it into an egg shape.<br>When you have used up all the mix, flour the croquettes, dip into beaten eggs, and then roll again in <br>breadcrumbs. Fry the bolinhos in very hot oil, once golden and cooked through place on paper towel to drain <br>and serve immediately.
