Cut larger mushrooms into 3 or 4 and leave<br>small ones complete.<br>Heat the oil in a pan and fry the garlic slivers until lightly golden,<br>now add the soaked shitake and stir fry for 1 minute.<br>Now add the remaining mushrooms and continue to fry<br>Add the rice wine, soy sause and oyster sauce, sugar and 4 tbsp<br>soaking water.<br>Reduce the heat and cook for about 8-minutes, stirring<br>constantly, until the mushrooms are cooked and most of the<br>liquid is gone.  While this is happening prepare your bok choy.<br>Serve onto the same platter as your cooked and waiting bok<br>choy, drizlle lightly with sesame oil and garnish with chopped<br>scallions and coriander<br>Wash your cut bok choy in a large bowl of water so the<br>vegetables are fully submerged. Agitating or stirring the<br>vegetables in the water will release any dirt or sand. Repeat this<br>process another 2 times or as necessary, until the water is clean<br>and there is no sand or dirt at the bottom of the bowl.<br>Bring 6 cups of water, 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, and 1<br>teaspoon salt to a boil. Blanch the bok choy for 40 seconds,<br>stirring occasionally. They should be just wilted and bright green.<br>Scoop out the bok choy into a bowl and pour 2 cups of cool<br>water over them. The water will stop the cooking process, but<br>you don’t want your veggies to be ice cold, so pour the bok choy<br>into a colander right after they’ve been submerged in the cool<br>water. Drain.<br>Next, arrange the bok choy into a circle around a large serving<br>plate, with a space in the middle for the mushrooms.
