<pre>
2 tbsp (30g) dried shitake mushrooms, rinsed
and soaked (soaking water retained)
1 tbsp oil
3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
230gms enoki or shimeji mushrooms
80g portabellini mushrooms, washed,
trimmed and sliced
2 tbsp rice wine vinegar
3 tbsp oyster sauce
1 tbsp soy sauce
2 tsp sugar
4 tbsp mushroom soaking water
2 tbsp minced green onions (scallions)
A few sprigs cilantro
300gms baby bok choy (280 grams, bottoms
trimmed and split in half lengthwise)
1tbsp vegetable oil
1 teaspoon salt
CHAO SAN GU & BOK CHOY 
Soak the shitake in warm water, once tender remove, reserve
soaking water.  Cut larger mushrooms into 3 or 4 and leave
small ones complete.
Heat the oil in a pan and fry the garlic slivers until lightly golden,
now add the soaked shitake and stir fry for 1 minute.
Now add the remaining mushrooms and continue to fry
Add the rice wine, soy sause and oyster sauce, sugar and 4 tbsp
soaking water.
Reduce the heat and cook for about 8-minutes, stirring
constantly, until the mushrooms are cooked and most of the
liquid is gone.  While this is happening prepare your bok choy.
Serve onto the same platter as your cooked and waiting bok
choy, drizlle lightly with sesame oil and garnish with chopped
scallions and coriander
Wash your cut bok choy in a large bowl of water so the
vegetables are fully submerged. Agitating or stirring the
vegetables in the water will release any dirt or sand. Repeat this
process another 2 times or as necessary, until the water is clean
and there is no sand or dirt at the bottom of the bowl.
Bring 6 cups of water, 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, and 1
teaspoon salt to a boil. Blanch the bok choy for 40 seconds,
stirring occasionally. They should be just wilted and bright green.
Scoop out the bok choy into a bowl and pour 2 cups of cool
water over them. The water will stop the cooking process, but
you don’t want your veggies to be ice cold, so pour the bok choy
into a colander right after they’ve been submerged in the cool
water. Drain.
Next, arrange the bok choy into a circle around a large serving
plate, with a space in the middle for the mushrooms.
