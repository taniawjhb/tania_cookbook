The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.
4 cups fresh basil leaves
1/2 cup almonds roasted
1/2 cup parmesan cheese grated or
shredded
3 cloves garlic
1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 cup olive oil - more if needed
salt and pepper to taste
3 vine-ripe tomatoes, 1/4-inch thick
slices
450gms fresh mozzarella, 1/4-inch thick
slices
20 to 30 leaves (about 1 bunch) fresh
basil
Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling
Coarse salt and pepper
Place all the ingredients in the bowl of a food processor
except the olive oil. Pulse until the mixture is chopped then
run the machine while adding the olive oil. Allow it to mix
until your desired texture.
Layer alternating slices of tomatoes and mozzarella, adding a
basil leaf between each, on a large, shallow platter. Drizzle
the salad with extra-virgin olive oil and season with salt and
pepper, to taste.
Drizzle the pistachio pesto over the salad right before serving,
if it is too thick dilute it with a bit of live oil.
