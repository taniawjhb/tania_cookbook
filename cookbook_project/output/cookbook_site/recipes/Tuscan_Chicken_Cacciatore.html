Tuscan Chicken Cacciatore
Knob of butter
2 tbsp olive oil
4 chicken legs, divided into thighs and drumsticks (skin removed if desired)
Seasoned flour, to dust
5 cloves garlic, peeled and left whole
Small bunch of rosemary
1 carrot, peeled and diced
1 stick of celery, diced
1 onion
Half a glass of white wine
250ml chicken stock
100g tinned plum tomatoes in juice, roughly chopped (or 100g really ripe fresh tomatoes, skinned and chopped)
Heat the butter and oil in a large, heavy-based casserole dish over a medium-high heat. Dust the chicken pieces
in seasoned flour, then fry them in batches until golden brown on all sides. Remove the chicken from the pan
and set aside.
Fry the onion, garlic, rosemary, carrot and celery, with a little more oil if necessary, for a few minutes until slightly
golden.
Pour in the wine and scrape the bottom of the pan to dislodge any crusty bits, then simmer until well reduced.
Tip in the stock, tomatoes and olives, and replace the chicken. Bring to a simmer, cover, turn down the heat and
cook gently for 45 minutes, until the meat is falling from the bone.
Season to taste and sprinkle genrously with fresh parsley
