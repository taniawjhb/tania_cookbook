BUTTERMILK SCONES
2 cups self-raising flour
1 tablespoon caster sugar
Pinch of salt
60g butter, chilled, chopped
3/4 cup buttermilk
Extra buttermilk, for brushing
Preheat oven to 220C/200C fan-forced. Line a baking tray with baking paper. Position oven rack in the top half of
oven.
Sift flour, sugar and salt into a bowl. Add butter. Using fingertips, rub butter into flour mixture until mixture
resembles fine breadcrumbs.
Make a well in centre of mixture. Add buttermilk. Using a flat-bladed knife, stir until a sticky dough forms. Turn out
onto a lightly floured surface. Knead gently until just smooth.
Using a lightly floured rolling pin, gently roll dough out until 2cm thick. Using a 6cm round cutter, cut out scones.
Press leftover dough together. Repeat to make 12 scones.
Place scones, just touching, on prepared tray. Brush with buttermilk. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden and
hollow when tapped on top. Serve with jam and cream.
