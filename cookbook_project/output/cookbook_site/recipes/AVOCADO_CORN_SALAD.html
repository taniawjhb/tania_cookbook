<h2>Ingredients</h2><br>3 cups cooked corn, about 3 medium/ large <br>ears of corn<br>1 red bell pepper<br>1 can of black beans, rinsed and drained<br>2 avocados, not overly ripe<br>¼ cup red onion<br>1 Jalapeño , optional<br>4 tbsp fresh cilantro<br>Dressing<br>¼ cup fresh lime juice, <br>1 tbsp apple cider vinegar<br>3 tbsp olive oil<br>1 tbsp honey,<br>1 tsp smoked paprika<br>¾ tsp kosher salt<br>¼ tsp pepper<br>¼ tsp garlic powder<br>2 tbsp fresh cilantro , optional for dressing<br>INSTRUCTIONS<br>Step 1:  If the corn is frozen, thaw it according to the package. <br>I prefer it fresh off the cob for extra crunch.  If using fresh corn <br>on the cob, peel and shuck it.<br>Step 2:   Mix up all the dressing ingredients in a small bowl, <br>apple cider vinegar, oil, seasoning, chopped cilantro, honey, <br>lime juice. Give it a taste and adjust as needed.<br>Step 3:  Chop up the jalapeño, red bell pepper, avocado, <br>onion, and cilantro into bite sized pieces. Try to keep <br>everything close in size to a piece of corn.<br>Step 4:  With a sharp knife and steady hand, place the corn <br>cob on a non slip cutting board vertically and use the knife to <br>slice all the corn kernels off in a downward direction. Gently <br>separate the kernels if they are all stuck together, some stuck <br>together is okay, and looks beautiful in the salad.<br>Step 5:  Assemble salad by adding all the ingredients <br>together, peppers, onion, black beans, cilantro, jalapeño, <br>avocado and pour dressing over the salad. Toss well, serve.<br>AVOCADO & CORN SALAD
