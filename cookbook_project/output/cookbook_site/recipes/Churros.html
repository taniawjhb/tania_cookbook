The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.
Churros
250ml water
1 tbsp granulated sugar
2.5ml salt
175gms cake flour
1 large egg, beaten
Oil for deep frying
Bring the water, salt and sugar to the boil. Remove from the heat and beat in the flour until you have a smooth paste. Now
add the well beaten egg and mix until the mixture is smooth and satiny.
Spoon the mixture into a piping bag with a large star nozzle fitted.
Heat the oil in a frying pan or saucepan, the oil should be deep enough that the churros can float. Pipe 7cm strips of the
batter into the hot oil a few at a time, cook for 3-4 minutes or until golden brown.
Drain the churros on kitchen towel before dusting with a mixture of caster sugar and fresh ground cinnamon.
