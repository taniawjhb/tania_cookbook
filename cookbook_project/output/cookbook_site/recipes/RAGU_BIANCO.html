RAGU BIANCO
WHITE RAGU
INGREDIENTS
525g minced beef (not too lean)
225 gr of salsiccia
Approximately 600 ml of meat stock
3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
1 large carrot or two small ones
1 - 2 ribs of celery
1 large or 2 medium onions
2 sprigs rosemary
2 bay leaves
Large pinch nutmeg
250ml dry white wine
1 1/2  tablespoon of cornstarch or cornstarch 
(or flour)
salt
METHOD
1. Finely chop the onion, carrot, and celery. Heat 2–3 
tablespoons of oil in a saucepan and sauté the 
vegetables for about 1 minute.  
2. Add the minced meat and the sausage (with the 
casing removed). Stir briefly, then mix in the 
spoonful of cornstarch—this trick helps achieve a 
creamy white ragù.  
3. Increase the heat and let the mixture cook until 
fragrant. Pour in the white wine and let it evaporate 
over high heat.  
4. Add 2–3 ladles of boiling meat broth, ensuring the 
meat is fully covered. Then, place two whole sprigs 
of rosemary, bay leaves and pinch of nutmeg in the 
pan.  
5. Cover and let it simmer over low heat for at least 
40 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.  
6. In the final few minutes, remove the lid and let 
the ragù thicken further on the heat. The texture 
should be creamy, rich, and not watery.  
7. Taste and adjust with salt as needed. If the sauce 
requires it, drizzle in another spoonful of olive oil 
before serving.
