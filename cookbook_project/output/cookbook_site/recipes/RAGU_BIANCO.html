RAGU BIANCO<br>WHITE RAGU<br><br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2><br>525g minced beef (not too lean)<br>225 gr of salsiccia<br>Approximately 600 ml of meat stock<br>3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil<br>1 large carrot or two small ones<br>1 - 2 ribs of celery<br>1 large or 2 medium onions<br>2 sprigs rosemary<br>2 bay leaves<br>Large pinch nutmeg<br>250ml dry white wine<br>1 1/2  tablespoon of cornstarch or cornstarch <br>(or flour)<br>salt<br><br><br><h2>Method</h2><br>1. Finely chop the onion, carrot, and celery. Heat 2–3 <br>tablespoons of oil in a saucepan and sauté the <br>vegetables for about 1 minute.  <br>2. Add the minced meat and the sausage (with the <br>casing removed). Stir briefly, then mix in the <br>spoonful of cornstarch—this trick helps achieve a <br>creamy white ragù.  <br>3. Increase the heat and let the mixture cook until <br>fragrant. Pour in the white wine and let it evaporate <br>over high heat.  <br>4. Add 2–3 ladles of boiling meat broth, ensuring the <br>meat is fully covered. Then, place two whole sprigs <br>of rosemary, bay leaves and pinch of nutmeg in the <br>pan.  <br>5. Cover and let it simmer over low heat for at least <br>40 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.  <br>6. In the final few minutes, remove the lid and let <br>the ragù thicken further on the heat. The texture <br>should be creamy, rich, and not watery.  <br>7. Taste and adjust with salt as needed. If the sauce <br>requires it, drizzle in another spoonful of olive oil <br>before serving.
