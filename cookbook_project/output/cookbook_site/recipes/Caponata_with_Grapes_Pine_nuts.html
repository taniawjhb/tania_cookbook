The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.<br>Caponata with Grapes & Pine nuts<br>1 kilo (2 lbs.) eggplant, cut into small cubes<br>1 bunch of celery, cut into bite-sized pieces<br>1 large onion, thinly sliced<br>1 small can of tomatoes or 250g (1/2 lb) fresh, skinned and seeded<br>Salt and pepper<br>A handful of capers<br>A handful of pignoli nuts<br>250g (1/2 lb.) of green olives, pitted and halved<br>1 cup seedless green grapes, halved<br>A sprig of fresh marjoram<br>1tsp sicilian oregano<br>Olive oil<br>Red wine vinegar & sugar, to taste<br>Gather up a handful of eggplant with a paper towel, give it a gentle squeeze to dry the cubes, and throw them<br>into abundant olive oil—about 1 cm (1/2 in) deep—in a large pot. (Enameled cast iron pots work particularly well.)<br>Work in batches to avoid crowding the eggplant, removing them with a skimmer when the eggplant cubes are<br>just lightly browned to a basket or bowl lined with paper towels to soak up the excess oil.<br>When all your eggplant is done, there should be less oil in the pan, but still enough to cook with. Add the celery,<br>sauté for a few minutes until the celery is tender but still has some ‘bite’ left in it. Season with salt and pepper as<br>it cooks. Remove with a skimmer and set aside.<br>Now add the onion to the remaining oil in the pot and sauté it gently until it is quite soft. Add the tomato. Simmer<br>the tomato until it has melted and reduced to a nice, sauce-like consistency.<br>Now add back your eggplant and celery, along with the capers, pine nuts, olives, grapes and the marjoram.<br>Allow everything to simmer together for about 5-10 minutes. A minute or two before it’s done, add the sugar and<br>vinegar, mix well (but gently!) and let it finish simmering. Turn off the heat and let the dish cool entirely before<br>serving.
