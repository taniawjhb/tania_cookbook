FATTOUSH
2 loaves pita bread
Early Harvest Extra Virgin Olive Oil
1/2 tsp sumac, more for later
Salt and pepper
1 heart of Romaine lettuce, chopped
1 English cucumber, chopped
5 Roma tomatoes, chopped
5 green onions (both white and green parts),
chopped
5 radishes, stems removed, thinly sliced
2 cups chopped fresh parsley leaves, stems
removed
1 cup chopped fresh mint leaves (optional)
1 1/2 lime, juice of
1/3 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil
Salt and pepper
1 tsp ground sumac
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
scant 1/4 tsp ground allspice
Toast the pita bread in your toaster oven until it is crisp but not
browned. Heat 3 tbsp of olive oil in a large pan. Break the pita
bread into pieces, and place in the heated oil. Fry briefly until
browned, tossing frequently. Add salt, pepper and 1/2 tsp of
sumac. Remove the pita chips from the heat and place on paper
towels to drain.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the chopped lettuce,
cucumber, tomatoes, green onions with the sliced radish and
parsley.
To make the lime vinaigrette, whisk together the lime
juice, olive oil and spices in a small bowl.
Dress the salad with the vinaigrette and toss lightly.
Finally, add the pita chips, and more sumac if you like, and toss
one more time. Transfer to small serving bowls or plates. Enjoy!
