APPLE & BLUEBERRY CRUMBLE
8 medium-large apples (4 tart (like granny smith), 4 sweet (like honey crisp) // organic when possible)
1 lemon, juiced (1 lemon yields ~ 2 Tbsp or 30 ml)
2/3 cup sugar
1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
3 Tbsp arrowroot starch or cornstarch (for thickening)
1/4 cup fresh apple juice (or water)
3/4 tsp fresh grated ginger (optional // or sub 1/2 tsp ground ginger per 3/4 tsp fresh)
1 pinch nutmeg (optional)
TOPPING
1 cup gluten-free rolled oats
1/2 cup almond meal
1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour*
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup muscovado sugar (or sub organic brown sugar)
1/2 cup pecans (roughly chopped)
1/4 tsp sea salt
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 cup olive oil
Preheat oven to 180 degrees C.
Peel apples, quarter, remove cores, and use a paring knife to thinly slice lengthwise
Add to a large mixing bowl and top with remaining filling ingredients. Toss to combine. Add to a 9x13 (or similar
size // as original recipe is written // use smaller or larger is altering batch size) baking dish.
Rinse and wipe out your mixing bowl and add all topping ingredients. Stir to combine, then use fingers to break
down any clumps of muscovado sugar. Pour over apples in an even layer.
Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour (uncovered) or until the filling is bubbly, the apples are very fork tender (especially in
the center of the dish), and the topping is deep golden brown.
Let rest at least 30 minutes before serving. This is delicious with coconut whipped cream or vanilla bean coconut
ice cream.
