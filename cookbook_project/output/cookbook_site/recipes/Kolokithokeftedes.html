Kolokithokeftedes<br>500 g zucchini, grated<br>2 spring onions, only the green part, thinly sliced<br>1 bunch of mint, only the leaves, finely chopped<br>1/3 bunch of dill, finely chopped<br>1 bunch of basil, finely chopped<br>grated zest of 2 limes<br>1 levelled teaspoon ground cumin<br>2 pinches chili flakes<br>200 g feta cheese, crumbled<br>2 eggs<br>80 g all-purpose flour<br>2-3 tablespoons olive oil<br>For Frying: 1/2 inch sunflower oil (or canola oil)<br>Line a large bowl with a thin kitchen towel. Grate the zucchini on to the towel in the bowl, using the large blades<br>of the grater.<br>Sprinkle with a generous amount of salt to help the zucchini release more moisture. Mix and squeeze the<br>mixture with your hands. Wrap in the towel and squeeze very tightly in your hands to release as much liquid as<br>possible. The less moisture the zucchini mixture has, the crunchier your fritters will become! Transfer from towel<br>to a clean, dry bowl.<br>Finely chop the green part of the spring onions. Finely chop the mint leaves, dill and basil and add them all to<br>the bowl. Add the lime zest, cumin, chili flakes, crumbled feta and 2 eggs. Mix until all of the <br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2> are<br>completely combined.<br>Add the flour and mix just to combine. Do not overmix.<br>Place a nonstick pan over medium to high heat. Add 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil. Pick up spoonfuls of the<br>mixture and carefully add them to the hot oil. Do not crowd your pan. Gently press down on the patties to spread<br>them out a little.<br>Fry on both sides until nice and golden, just like pancakes! When ready, transfer to a plate lined with paper<br>towels so they can drain from excess oil. Repeat the same process until all of your mixture has turned in to<br>crunchy fritters.<br>The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.
