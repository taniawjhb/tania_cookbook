The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.<br>Pasteis de Nata<br>Now you too know how to make your own<br>1 whole egg (large)<br>2 egg yolks (large)<br>100g caster sugar<br>2 tbsp cornflour<br>400ml full cream milk<br>2 tsp vanilla extract<br>1 piece of lemon rind<br>1 cinnamon quill<br>1 sheet ready rolled puff pastry<br>1. Grease a muffin tray with butter, pop into the fridge, preheat your oven to 180C then start with the custard.<br>1. Mix the 2 yolks, full egg,  corn flour, vanilla and sugar. Mix well until mixture lightens in colour and sugar is given time to<br>dissolve<br>2. Heat the milk in a saucepan on a medium heat with lemon and cinnamon until just hot. Slowly add warmed milk bit by<br>bit to the egg mixture, whisking constantly so that the eggs doesn’t split.<br>3. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and heat until custard thickens. This should happen quite rapidly.<br>4. Once thickened, remove from heat, pour into a glass bowl, place cling film ON the surface of the custard so that it doesn’t<br>make a skin and chill.<br>5. In the meantime, cut pastry sheet into two pieces and place them on top of each other. Roll the pastry tightly, from the<br>short side, into a log and cut the log into 12 even sized discs.<br>6. Take each disk, and working on a lightly floured surface, roll each disk out into 10cm disks, and press the pastry into the<br>muffin tray<br>7. Once custard is cooled, scoop the custard into the pastry bases filling them just shy of the brim (about 3/4 full)<br>8. Pop the tray into the oven for 20-25 minutes until dark patches start appearing on the custard. The custard might rise, this<br>is ok, it will sink again.<br>9. Remove from oven. IF NECESSARY switch oven to high heat grill. Once oven is ready, pop them back in for 2-3 minutes to<br>finish giving them their dark patches and colouring.<br>10. Serve hot or cold, with a dusting of icing sugar and cinnamon if desired.
