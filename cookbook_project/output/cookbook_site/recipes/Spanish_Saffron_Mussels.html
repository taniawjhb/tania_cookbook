Spanish Saffron Mussels<br>1/2 cup dry sherry a pinch of saffron<br>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper<br>1 tablespoon olive oil (I like Spanish olive oil)<br>1 teaspoon garlic (minced)<br>1 shallot (finely chopped)<br>2 ounces Spanish chorizo 1/4" dice* 4 cups seafood broth/stock*<br>1 teaspoon smoked paprika (hot or mild)<br>1 bay leaf<br>2 1/2 to 3 pounds fresh mussels (see notes) parsley to garnish<br>Warm the sherry (30 seconds in the microwave works), and add the pinch of saffron.<br>To a deep pot with a lid over medium-high heat, add a drizzle of olive oil, the garlic, shallot, and crushed red pepper.<br>When the shallot and garlic are fragrant (not browned), add the diced chorizo. Saute until the chorizo begins to give up some color, and <br>shallot is transparent - about 5 minutes total.<br>Add the broth/stock, saffron infused sherry, smoked paprika, and bay leaf. Lower heat and simmer while you prepare the baguette.<br>Just prior to serving, add the mussels to the pot, cover, and cook 2 to 3 minutes (until the mussels are open). Ladle the broth over the <br>mussels to let the shells catch a bit of the goodness, then ladle into shallow bowls.<br>Garnish with chopped parsley and toasted baguette.<br>The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.
