TRUFFLE AIOLI
TRUFFLE MAYO
INGREDIENTS
1 egg yolk room temperature
1 teaspoon Dĳon mustard
1 teaspoon lemon juice
¼ teaspoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon truffle oil black truffle preferred
Up to ¾ cup neutral oil such as vegetable oil or 
grapeseed oil
1 garlic clove minced or grated
METHOD
1. Whisk together egg yolk, dĳon mustard, lemon 
juice, and salt in a small-medium bowl. I like to use a 
glass bowl so you can really see what is happening.
2.  In a measuring cup with a spout, combine the 
truffle oil and neutral oil.
3.  Very slowly, begin to drip the oil into the bowl 
with the egg mixture, whisking constantly and 
vigorously. You are making an emulsion, and 
emulsions are very tricky. At the beginning, you must 
literally add the oil drop by drop, making sure it is 
incorporated before adding more.
4.  The mixture will thicken little by little at first, and 
then faster and faster. Once you have added about 
¼ cup of the oil, you can speed up the rate at which 
you are adding the oil.
5.  Continue to whisk constantly, taking a break if 
your arm tires. If your bowl is moving around a lot, 
you can try stabilizing it by placing it on top of a 
damp kitchen towel. After about ½ cup of oil has 
been added, you can speed up even more until all 
the oil is incorporated.
6.  If the aioli is too thick, add a teaspoon of water 
at a time to loosen it up to what you desire.
7.  Whisk in the minced garlic and let sit for at least 
10 minutes, to allow the flavors to meld.
