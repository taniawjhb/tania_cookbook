TRUFFLE AIOLI<br>TRUFFLE MAYO<br><br><br><h2>Ingredients</h2><br>1 egg yolk room temperature<br>1 teaspoon Dĳon mustard<br>1 teaspoon lemon juice<br>¼ teaspoon kosher salt<br>1 tablespoon truffle oil black truffle preferred<br>Up to ¾ cup neutral oil such as vegetable oil or <br>grapeseed oil<br>1 garlic clove minced or grated<br><br><br><h2>Method</h2><br>1. Whisk together egg yolk, dĳon mustard, lemon <br>juice, and salt in a small-medium bowl. I like to use a <br>glass bowl so you can really see what is happening.<br>2.  In a measuring cup with a spout, combine the <br>truffle oil and neutral oil.<br>3.  Very slowly, begin to drip the oil into the bowl <br>with the egg mixture, whisking constantly and <br>vigorously. You are making an emulsion, and <br>emulsions are very tricky. At the beginning, you must <br>literally add the oil drop by drop, making sure it is <br>incorporated before adding more.<br>4.  The mixture will thicken little by little at first, and <br>then faster and faster. Once you have added about <br>¼ cup of the oil, you can speed up the rate at which <br>you are adding the oil.<br>5.  Continue to whisk constantly, taking a break if <br>your arm tires. If your bowl is moving around a lot, <br>you can try stabilizing it by placing it on top of a <br>damp kitchen towel. After about ½ cup of oil has <br>been added, you can speed up even more until all <br>the oil is incorporated.<br>6.  If the aioli is too thick, add a teaspoon of water <br>at a time to loosen it up to what you desire.<br>7.  Whisk in the minced garlic and let sit for at least <br>10 minutes, to allow the flavors to meld.
