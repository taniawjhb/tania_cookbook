Sundried Tomato & Ricotta Twisted
Loaf
2 1/4 cups flour
1/2 tsp salt
3/4 cup lukewarm milk
1 tbsp sugar
15 g fresh yeast (1 envelope active dry yeast)
1/8 cup (30 g) melted butter
1 egg yolk
1/4 cup (70 g) softened butter
5 tbsp grated parmesan
120gms sundried tomato halves
200gms ricotta cheese
100gms grated white cheddar
In a medium bowl stir fresh yeast with sugar until it liquefies. Stir in the lukewarm milk and then add the egg yolk and
melted butter. In a large bowl whisk together the flour and salt.
Pour the milk mixture over the dry ingredients and start kneading it until it pulls away from the edges of the bowl. Give the
dough the shape of a ball. Sprinkle oil onto a clean bowl, place the dough and cover with plastic wrap. Let it rest for about 1
hour at room temperature (warm space) until doubled in size.
While the dough rises, process together the butter, sundried tomatoes, parmesan & ricotta cheese. Set aside.
Preheat the oven to 400 F (200 C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. On a floured surface, using a rolling pin roll the
dough to a rectangle of about 18x12 inches. Spoon the filling over top (keep about 1 tbsp of the filling for the end),
spreading evenly, leaving a clean 1/2-inch border around the edges. Sprinkle the grated chedda cheeseâ€™.
Roll up the dough and using a sharp knife, cut the log in half lengthwise leaving one edge uncut for about 1/2 inch. Start
braiding the two pieces, trying to keep the open layers exposed so the cut ends remain on top (this is what makes this
bread effect).Pinch the ends together. Transfer it to the prepared baking sheet.
Brush the wreath with the left butter filling. Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown. For the last 10 minutes you can
reduce the oven temperature to 180 C (350 F).
