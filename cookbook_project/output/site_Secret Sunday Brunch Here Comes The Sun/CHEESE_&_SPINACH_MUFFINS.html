CHEESE & SPINACH MUFFINS
2 medium eggs
150ml / 1/2 cup milk
75g / 1/2 cup butter, melted
150g / 2 cups grated cheddar cheese
1 spring onion, chopped
75g / 2 cups fresh baby spinach, chopped
1/2 red pepper, diced, and lightly pan fried
250g / 2 cups self raising flour
1/2 vegetable stock cube (can use low or no sodium stock cube)
salt and pepper to taste (but can be left out)
Preheat the oven to 180Cand line a muffin tin with 12 muffin cases.
Gently whisk the eggs in a large bowl and stir in the milk and melted butter. Mix in the grated cheese, spring
onion, baby spinach and diced cooked red pepper.
Finally, add in the flour, salt and pepper (if using) and crumble in the stock cube and mix just enough until all the
ingredients have combined.
Divide the mixture between the 12 muffin cases and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes until cooked through (a
skewer stuck into the middle should come out dry).
These muffins can be frozen once they have cooled completely. To defrost simply leave out for a few hours or
overnight.
