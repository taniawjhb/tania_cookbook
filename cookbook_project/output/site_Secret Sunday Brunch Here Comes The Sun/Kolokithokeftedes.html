Kolokithokeftedes
500 g zucchini, grated
2 spring onions, only the green part, thinly sliced
1 bunch of mint, only the leaves, finely chopped
1/3 bunch of dill, finely chopped
1 bunch of basil, finely chopped
grated zest of 2 limes
1 levelled teaspoon ground cumin
2 pinches chili flakes
200 g feta cheese, crumbled
2 eggs
80 g all-purpose flour
2-3 tablespoons olive oil
For Frying: 1/2 inch sunflower oil (or canola oil)
Line a large bowl with a thin kitchen towel. Grate the zucchini on to the towel in the bowl, using the large blades
of the grater.
Sprinkle with a generous amount of salt to help the zucchini release more moisture. Mix and squeeze the
mixture with your hands. Wrap in the towel and squeeze very tightly in your hands to release as much liquid as
possible. The less moisture the zucchini mixture has, the crunchier your fritters will become! Transfer from towel
to a clean, dry bowl.
Finely chop the green part of the spring onions. Finely chop the mint leaves, dill and basil and add them all to
the bowl. Add the lime zest, cumin, chili flakes, crumbled feta and 2 eggs. Mix until all of the ingredients are
completely combined.
Add the flour and mix just to combine. Do not overmix.
Place a nonstick pan over medium to high heat. Add 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil. Pick up spoonfuls of the
mixture and carefully add them to the hot oil. Do not crowd your pan. Gently press down on the patties to spread
them out a little.
Fry on both sides until nice and golden, just like pancakes! When ready, transfer to a plate lined with paper
towels so they can drain from excess oil. Repeat the same process until all of your mixture has turned in to
crunchy fritters.
