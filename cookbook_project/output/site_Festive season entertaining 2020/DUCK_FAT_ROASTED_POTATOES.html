<h1>DUCK FAT ROASTED POTATOES</h1>

DUCK FAT ROASTED POTATOES
1kg potatoes, peeled and cut into pieces
170g duck fat
½ tbs salt
2 tbs polenta
Preheat your oven to 240ºC
Place the duck fat in a roasting tray & place in the oven to start
heating up. The secret to these potatoes is to get the duck fat
ferociously hot.
In a large pot, cover the potatoes with cold water, season well &
bring to the boil. Parboil the potatoes for no more than 10
minutes.  Drain the potatoes & return them to the pot
Place the polenta/semolina in the pot, cover tightly & give the
potatoes a ferocious shake to coat them evenly & smash up
their edges a bit (these are the parts that really crisp up nicely)
Carefully remove the tray from the oven & using a pair of tongs,
place the potatoes gently into the sizzling duck fat
Return the tray to the oven & roast the potatoes for 1 hour,
turning them throughout the cooking time so that they brown on
all sides
Remove from the trays, drain on some kitchen towel & serve
immediately. Golden, crusty, crunchy perfection
