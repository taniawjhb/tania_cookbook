MANGO & LIME ICECREAM
3/4 cup thawed frozen mango pulp
1/3 cup sweetened condensed milk
Grated zest and juice of 1 lime
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 teaspoon coconut extract
150ml unsweetened coconut cream, chilled
1 cup cold heavy cream
Whisk the mango pulp, condensed milk, lime zest and juice,
confectioners' sugar and coconut extract in a large bowl until
smooth; set aside.
Scoop the solids off the top of the can of coconut cream into a
separate large bowl. (Discard the liquid; if any liquid has risen to
the top, pour it off before scooping out the solids.) Break the solid
coconut cream into small chunks, then add the heavy cream
and beat with a mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks
form, 1 to 2 minutes. (There may be a few small chunks of
coconut cream.)
Fold about half of the whipped cream into the mango mixture
with a rubber spatula until combined, then fold in the remaining
whipped cream until no white streaks remain.
Spoon the mixture into a freezer-safe 9-by-5-inch loaf pan or
2-quart baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until firm
and scoopable, at least 6 hours or overnight. Let soften about 20
minutes at room temperature before scooping.
