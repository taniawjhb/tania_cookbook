FINGERS
In a saucepan over medium heat, combine syrup ingredients until it
boils, reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.

simple syrup and the rose water to the pistachios and mix well until
you get a sticky coarse paste.

Brush the finished roll with more butter and place in a baking sheet.
Bake in oven until top is golden brown, about 40 minutes

Pour 1/2 to 1 cup of simple syrup over and let it cool completely,
preferable overnight if you can.
Take phyllo cigars out, cut into 2 or 4 equal parts.
