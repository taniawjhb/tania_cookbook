<h1>MUSHROOM GALETTE</h1>
<pre>
1 1/4 cup unbleached white flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
8 Tablespoons frozen unsalted butter cut into
small pieces
1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt
1/4 cup ice cold water
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 cup ricotta
Kosher salt
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
4 ounces maitake mushrooms, torn, and/or
crimini mushrooms, thinly sliced
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
1 large bunch Swiss chard, ribs and stems
removed, leaves cut into bite-size pieces
All-purpose flour (for parchment)
1 large egg, beaten to blend
1 cup mixed fresh tender herbs (such as flat-
leaf parsley, cilantro, dill, and/or chives)
1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
To prepare crust, combine flour and salt in the bowl of a food
processor. Pulse twice to combine. Add butter and pulse until
mixture resembles coarse meal. Transfer mixture to a large bowl.
In a smaller bowl, whisk together yogurt, water, and lemon juice.
Pour over flour mixture and use hands or a wooden spoon to
form dough into a ball. Wrap in plastic and store in freezer for 20
minutes.
Preheat oven to 200°C. Season ricotta with kosher salt and
pepper; set aside.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Add mushrooms; season with kosher salt and pepper and cook,
stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, about 5
minutes. Transfer to a small bowl.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in same skillet over medium heat. Cook
garlic, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add half of chard,
season with kosher salt and pepper, and cook, tossing, until
slightly wilted. Add remaining chard and cook, tossing
occasionally, until completely wilted, about 4 minutes. Remove
from heat; season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
Roll out dough on a lightly floured sheet of parchment to a 14"
round about 1/8" thick. Transfer on parchment to a baking sheet.
Spread three-fourths of ricotta over dough, leaving a 1 1/2"
border. Top with reserved chard, then mushrooms. Dollop
remaining ricotta over vegetables. Bring edges of dough up and
over filling, overlapping as needed, to create a 1 1/2" border;
brush with egg. Bake galette, rotating once, until crust is golden
brown and cooked through, 35–40 minutes. Let cool slightly on
baking sheet.
Toss herbs with lemon juice and remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a
small bowl; season with pepper. Top galette with herbs, zest,
and sea salt.
