GOLDEN ROAST CHICKEN
1.75 - 2 kg whole chicken, patted dry
Salt and pepper
2 tsp olive oil
1 lemon, quartered
3 rosemary sprigs
100 g, melted
3 garlic cloves , minced
1 tbsp sage , finely chopped
2 tsp rosemary , finely chopped
1 tbsp parsley , finely chopped
1/2 tsp each salt and black pepper
1 cup / 250 ml dry white wine , or low sodium
Take the chicken out of the fridge 30 minutes before cooking.
Preheat oven to 220C/450F (standard) or 200C/430F
(fan/convection). Put shelf in the middle.
Mix together Butter ingredients. Add juice from 2 wedges of
lemon.
Place chicken in a roasting pan. Use a dessert spoon to loosen
skin from chicken. Do the top (the breast) and the drumsticks –
not the underside.
Prop chicken upright, drizzle butter under skin, using most of the
garlic/herb sludge, but saving a bit of butter for the skin (Note 3).
Drizzle / smear remaining butter all over surface of the chicken.
Squeeze over juice of 2 lemon wedges.
Stuff used lemon wedges and rosemary inside chicken.
Tie drumstick ends with string and tuck wing tips under the
chicken.
Sprinkle all over with salt and pepper.
Place onion and garlic in the pan, place chicken on top. Pour
wine around, drizzle chicken with oil.
Transfer to oven. Roast for 10 minutes, then turn oven down to
180C/350F (all oven types). Roast for a further 1 hr 15 minutes, or
until the internal temperature is 75C/165F or until juices run clear
when pierced at the join between the drumstick and the body.
Baste twice (30 min then at 1 hr), spooning pan juices over skin.
Rest for 15 minutes – don’t cover, skin becomes wet.
Serve with pan juices (see video for how to carve). I discard
onion but use the garlic in the pan.
