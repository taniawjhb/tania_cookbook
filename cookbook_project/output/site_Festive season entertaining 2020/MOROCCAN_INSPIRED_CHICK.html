2 tspn ground cumin
2 tspn garam masala
1 tspn harissa

low heat saute the onions and garlic for a couple of minutes
until translucent.

After the vegetables are cooked through in the stew
remove the lid, stir through the sugar, currants, salt and pepper

desired thickness. Taste and add more sugar or salt and pepper
if desired.
