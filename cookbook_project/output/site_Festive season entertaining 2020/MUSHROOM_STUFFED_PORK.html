MUSHROOM STUFFED PORK
TENDERLOIN
5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more
for brushing
4 slices bacon, chopped
8 ounces cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1 tablespoon breadcrumbs
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
2 pork tenderloins (2 to 2 1/2 pounds total),
trimmed
1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over
medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until crisp, about 8
minutes. Add the mushrooms, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper to
taste; cook until the mushrooms are soft, about 4 minutes. Add
the garlic and cook 1 minute.
Remove from the heat and stir in the breadcrumbs and
all but 2 tablespoons parsley. Let cool.
Soak 10 to 12 toothpicks in water to prevent them from burning.
Rinse the pork and pat dry. Butterfly the pork: Make a 1-inch-
deep incision down the length of each tenderloin; do not cut all
the way through. Open the meat like a book so the tenderloins
lie flat.
Cover the pork with plastic wrap; pound with the flat
side of a meat mallet until about 1/2 inch thick, starting from the
middle and working outward. Spread the mushroom mixture
over the 2 tenderloins. Starting with a long side, tightly roll up
each tenderloin. Secure the seams with the toothpicks.
Heat the same skillet over medium heat and add 2
Tbsp oil. Once oil is hot, place tenderloin in the skillet (toothpick-
side-down) and sear about 2 minutes per side (6-8 minutes
total).
Transfer the skillet with the tenderloin to the oven and
bake at 400˚F for 18-20 min or until an instant read thermometer
reads 145-150˚F in the thickest portion of the meat.  Transfer to a
cutting board, brush with the pan drippings and rest 10 minutes.
Mix the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil and 2
tablespoons parsley, the lemon zest, and salt and pepper to
taste in a bowl. Remove the toothpicks and slice the pork rolls.
Top with parsley oil.  Serve hot.
