INGREDIENTS
500g roasted peanuts
Blended Paste
25g dried chillies, rehydrated in hot water 
and chopped
1 onion, chopped
4-5 shallots, chopped
5 cloves garlic
1-inch ginger, chopped
1-inch galangal, chopped
2 stalks lemongrass, bruised and sliced
1 tsp shrimp paste
1/4 cup water, for easier blending
Peanut Sauce
1 cup vegetable oil, with extra on the side
4 cups water, with extra on the side
100g palm sugar, or to taste
1 tbsp salt, or to taste
1 cup coconut milk
2 tbsps tamarind paste, or to taste
1 tbsp dark sweet soy sauce
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Add peanuts to a blender or food processor. Give 
them a rough pulse, so that you get chunks of peanuts in the 
sauce. Once processed, remove and set to one side.
Blending the Aromatic Paste
1.  Soak the dried chillies with hot water for 5 minutes, or until 
the chillies rehydrate and soften. 
2.  Once rehydrated, drain and chop dried chillies to smaller 
pieces for easier blending.
3.  Peel and roughly chop the onions and shallots, garlic, 
ginger and galangal.
4.  Remove the hard outer layer of lemongrass, and the top 
and bottom root part. Bruise lemongrass with the back of the 
knife, or a pestle to release fragrance. Slice at a diagonal.
5.  Add all of the prepped ingredients in the blender. Add 
about 1/4 cup of water, for easier blending. Turn the blender 
on and blitz to a smooth paste.
Making the Peanut Sauce
Step 1:  Add plenty of oil to the wok, and heat over low to 
medium heat. Once hot, add the blended paste.
Step 2:  Continuously stir fry until the paste is fragrant and 
slightly dries down. The paste should have emulsified and 
released oil. If the paste is too dry before oil is released, add 
more oil. This ‘pecah minyak’ or oil splitting process can take 
10 minutes or so. Once the dried chilli paste has cooked 
down, add the blitzed peanuts and water. Stir to combine.
Step 3:  Add your blocks of palm sugar and salt to taste. Let 
this to come to a boil, before turning the heat down and allow 
to simmer for 15 minutes, or until the palm sugar blocks melt.
Step 4:  Once the palm sugar has melted, add coconut milk 
and tamarind paste. If too much liquid has cooked off, add 
more water. Add dark sweet soy sauce.
Step 5:  Let sauce come up to another boil. Taste test and 
season accordingly with sugar and salt, if needed.  Once 
you’re happy with the taste, satay sauce is done. Serve hot!
