<h1>PASSION FRUIT & COCONUT</h1>
<pre>
1 cup passionfruit puree
1 can (400ml) coconut milk
1 can (400gms) condensed milk
1 cup heavy cream
¼ cup milk powder
Blend all the ingredients together in a blender till well combined.
Transfer to ice cream maker and freeze according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
To make this ice cream without an ice cream maker, after you
have blended all the ingredients, either transfer it in into the
container that you plan to freeze the ice cream in, or if you have
enough freezer space leave the blended ice cream in the
blender. After 45min- 1 hour check on it and if you see the
mixture freezing at the edges, remove from freezer and give it a
whizz. Repeat process 3-4 times and then transfer to the
container you want the ice cream to freeze in and let freeze
completely.
