Caponata with Grapes & Pine nuts
1 kilo (2 lbs.) eggplant, cut into small cubes
1 bunch of celery, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 large onion, thinly sliced
1 small can of tomatoes or 250g (1/2 lb) fresh, skinned and seeded
Salt and pepper
A handful of capers
A handful of pignoli nuts
250g (1/2 lb.) of green olives, pitted and halved
1 cup seedless green grapes, halved
A sprig of fresh marjoram
1tsp sicilian oregano
Olive oil
Red wine vinegar & sugar, to taste
Gather up a handful of eggplant with a paper towel, give it a gentle squeeze to dry the cubes, and throw them
into abundant olive oil—about 1 cm (1/2 in) deep—in a large pot. (Enameled cast iron pots work particularly well.)
Work in batches to avoid crowding the eggplant, removing them with a skimmer when the eggplant cubes are
just lightly browned to a basket or bowl lined with paper towels to soak up the excess oil.
When all your eggplant is done, there should be less oil in the pan, but still enough to cook with. Add the celery,
sauté for a few minutes until the celery is tender but still has some ‘bite’ left in it. Season with salt and pepper as
it cooks. Remove with a skimmer and set aside.
Now add the onion to the remaining oil in the pot and sauté it gently until it is quite soft. Add the tomato. Simmer
the tomato until it has melted and reduced to a nice, sauce-like consistency.
Now add back your eggplant and celery, along with the capers, pine nuts, olives, grapes and the marjoram.
Allow everything to simmer together for about 5-10 minutes. A minute or two before it’s done, add the sugar and
vinegar, mix well (but gently!) and let it finish simmering. Turn off the heat and let the dish cool entirely before
serving.
