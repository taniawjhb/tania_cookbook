<pre>
FOR THE ASPARAGUS AND PANGRATTATO
1 kg asparagus washed, dried and wood 
ends removed if necessary
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
2 tablespoons olive oil
5 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup fresh grated Parmesan cheese (or 
Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese)
1/2 cup Panko breadcrumbs
2 teaspoons parsley, finely chopped
Zest of 1 lemon
Salt and pepper, to taste (about 1/2-3/4 
teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper)
Instructions
Step 1: Preheat the oven to 205Â°C.  Lightly grease a baking 
tray or sheet with non stick cooking oil spray.
Step 2:  Place the trimmed asparagus in a bowl. In a second 
bowl combine the butter, olive oil, 1 large clove minced garlic, 
parsely and bread crumbs, mix to combine well.  If the 
mixture is too wet add an additional tbsp of bread crumbs.  
Step 3:  Add the crumb mixture to the asparagus and mix by 
hands to carefully and evenly coat the asparagus with the oil 
and crumbs.  
Step 4:  Transfer the asparagus and breadcrumb mixture onto 
prepared baking sheet and arrange into one even layer. Bake 
for about 10 minutes, or until the asparagus are just tender.
Step 5:  Grill for 2-3 minutes until breadcrumbs are golden 
browned and asparagus has reached desired doneness  
Serve warm on a warmed platter.
