<h1>CROSTINI WITH WHITE BEANS</h1>
<pre>
1 baguette
Olive oil for drizzling
For the cannellini bean purée
400g tin cannellini beans, rinsed 
and drained
1 small clove garlic
Grated zest and juice 1 lemon
50ml olive oil
For the anchovy salsa
Handful fresh flatleaf parsley
50g good quality anchovy fillets in 
olive oil, drained
2 tbsp capers, drained
½ garlic clove, finely grated
Grated zest and juice 1 lemon
2-3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
Step 1:  Heat the oven to 160°C. Cut the baguette diagonally into 
thin slices and arrange on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil 
and bake for 10-12 minutes until crisp. Set aside to cool.
Step 2:  Put the beans, garlic, lemon zest and half the juice in a 
food processor. Pulse briefly while drizzling in the 50ml olive oil to 
give a chunky purée. Add salt and pepper, along with more 
lemon juice if needed
Step 3:  For the salsa: chop the parsley, anchovies and capers, 
transfer to a bowl and add the garlic, lemon zest and juice. Add 
the olive oil to cover. Stir well and season with salt, pepper and 
more lemon juice if needed.

generously with anchovy salsa to serve.
