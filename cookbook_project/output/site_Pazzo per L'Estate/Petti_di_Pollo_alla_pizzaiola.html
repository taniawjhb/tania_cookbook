Petti di Pollo alla pizzaiola
Chicken Breasts with a rich tomato sauce
4 chicken breasts
2tbsp cake flour, seasoned with salt & pepper
Olive oil to fry
1 onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 red bell pepper, stem and seeds removed and sliced julienne
1 green bell pepper, stem and seeds removed and sliced julienne
2 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley leaves
1 tablespoon freshly chopped basil leaves
2 teaspoon freshly chopped oregano leaves
1 can crushed tomatoes
30 gms capers
30 gms anchovy fillets
1 bay leaf
1 tablespoon olive oil
Cut each chicken breast into 4 strips. Dust lightly with seasoned flour and cook in a pan until browned and just
cooked through. Set aside.
In the same pan as the chicken, heat the olive oil in a large saute pan and cook the onions, anchovies, garlic,
and red and green peppers until the onions begin to turn translucent and the peppers begin to soften, being
careful not to burn the garlic. Stir in the parsley, basil, and oregano. Add the crushed tomatoes and bay leaf. Over
medium heat, bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and allow to simmer for about 20 minutes.
To serve, place the chicken in a dish and then top with the hot pizzaiola sauce.
