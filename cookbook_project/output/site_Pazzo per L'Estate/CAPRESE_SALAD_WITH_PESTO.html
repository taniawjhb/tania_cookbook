4 cups fresh basil leaves

1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 cup olive oil - more if needed

Place all the ingredients in the bowl of a food processor
except the olive oil. Pulse until the mixture is chopped then
run the machine while adding the olive oil. Allow it to mix
until your desired texture.
Layer alternating slices of tomatoes and mozzarella, adding a
basil leaf between each, on a large, shallow platter. Drizzle
the salad with extra-virgin olive oil and season with salt and
pepper, to taste.
Drizzle the pistachio pesto over the salad right before serving,
if it is too thick dilute it with a bit of live oil.
