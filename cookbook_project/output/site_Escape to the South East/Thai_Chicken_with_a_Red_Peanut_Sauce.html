Thai Chicken with a Red Peanut Sauce
For the Chicken
1/4 cup soy sauce (use gluten-free if needed)
3 tablespoons dark brown sugar, packed
Zest of one lime
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/2 teaspoon salt
2-1/2 - 3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts
For the Coconut-Peanut Sauce
1 (13-oz) can coconut milk (do not use low fat)
1/4 cup peanut butter
1/3 cup dark brown sugar, packed
1-1/2 tablespoons soy sauce (use gluten-free if needed)
1 tablespoon red curry paste
3 tablespoons fresh lime juice, from 2 limes
1 lime, cut into wedges (optional)
Cut the thighs into medium sized chunks and set aside.
Make the marinade by combining the soy sauce, dark brown sugar, lime zest, vegetable oil, garlic, curry powder, ginger, cardamom and
salt in a large bowl. Add the chicken pieces to the bowl and mix until chicken is evenly coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and
marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight.
Make the sauce by whisking together the coconut milk, peanut butter, brown sugar, soy sauce and red curry paste in a medium
saucepan. Bring to a simmer, then cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes. Add the fresh lime juice. Set aside.
Preheat the grill to high heat. Meanwhile, thread the chicken pieces onto skewers. Grease the grill. Place the skewers on the grill and
cook for about 10 minutes, turning once, or until the chicken is cooked through. Serve the chicken skewers with the Coconut-Peanut
Sauce and lime wedges, if desired.
