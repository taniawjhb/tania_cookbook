Thai Tea Cake with Condesed 
Milk Custard Sauce Recipe
INGREDIENTS
1 1/4 whole milk, room temperature
1 ceylon tea bag
1 small cinnamon stick
1 star anise / 1 tsp of anise seeds
6 cardamom pods
1/2 tsp turmeric
1 tsp vanilla extra
113g butter, softened
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
3 large eggs, room temperature
281g  all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
For ths custard
6 large egg yolks
3/4 cup milk
1 can condensed milk
1 tsp vanilla extract
INGREDIENTS
STEP 1:  Seperate 1 1/4 cups of milk and place in a small saucepan 
over low heat.  To this add 1 ceylon tea bag, 1 stick cinnamon, 6 
cardamom pods, 1 star anise and a 1/2 tsp of tumeric.  As soon as 
you see small bubbles around the edge of the pot, switch off the 
heat and allow the tea to infuse for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, 
until the liquid is cool.  To this add 1tsp of vanilla extra. 
STEP 2:  Grease  25cm springform pan , and line it with a piece of 
parchment paper; set aside. Preheat oven to 180Â° .
STEP 3:  In a medium bowl stir together flour, salt, and baking powder; 
set aside. In a large mixing bowl beat butter with an electric mixer on 
medium speed until fluffy, about 30 seconds. Add sugar, 1/4 cup at a 
time, and continue to beat until the mixture is well combined, 
scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.
STEP 4:  Add eggs to the butter mixture, one at a time, beating after 
each addition, about 1 minute total.
STEP 5:  Strain cooled tea-infused milk through a fine mesh strainer. 
With a rubber spatula, alternately fold in flour mixture and tea-infused 
milk to butter mixture. Once the batter is well combined, spread it into 
the prepared pan, and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center 
comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove the cake from the oven 
and let it cool in the pan.
STEP 1:  Meanwhile, make the custard sauce by putting 3/4 milk and 
condensed milk in a heavy-bottomed pot or sauce pan over 
medium-low heat, whisking to combine. 
STEP 2:  Place egg yolks in a medium mixing bowl and whisk until 
smooth.
STEP 3:  Once the condensed milk mixture starts to boil, immediately 
remove the pot from heat. With one hand, slowly pour the hot milk 
into the yolks in thin stream. With the other hand, whisk the mixture 
vigorously making sure everything is well blended.
STEP 4:  Pour the egg mixture back into the empty milk pot and put it 
on low heat, whisking constantly. In less than a minute, the custard 
sauce will thicken up. Take the pot off the heat, strain the custard 
through a fine-mesh strainer into a serving container, preferable one 
with a spout; keep covered and warm. (You should end up with 
approximately 2 1/2 cups of sauce.)
