Feijoada
1 onion cut, into dice
1 carrot cut, into dice
1 medium potato cut into dice
1 stalk of celery cut into small pieces
1 Portuguese chorizo
1 medium can 420 gr red kidney beans (with the liquid of the can)
½ can 210 gr white beans drained.
2 cups fresh spinach
1 garlic clove minced
1 tbsp tomato paste
1 cup of meat broth
1 cup water
1 bay leaf
1 tsp thyme
Sprinkle of pepper
1 tsp olive oil
1. In a big sauté pan over medium heat pour the olive oil and cook the chorizo cut into slices. Remove the
chorizo from the pan when it is semi-crispy and has released its natural oil. That’s the key for the flavor.
2. Toss the onion and after a couple minutes add the garlic and cook until the onion is almost transparent.
3. Toss the carrot, the potato, the celery and the tomato paste. Stir well.
4. Add the red kidney beans (with the liquid), the white beans, the chorizo and the spinach. Pour the meat broth
and the water. Season with the bay leaf, thyme, and pepper. Simmer for about 15 minutes over medium
heat.
5. Remove the bay leaf and serve with some fluffy white rice.
