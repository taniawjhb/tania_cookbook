Pasteis de Nata
Now you too know how to make your own
1 whole egg (large)
2 egg yolks (large)
100g caster sugar
2 tbsp cornflour
400ml full cream milk
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 piece of lemon rind
1 cinnamon quill
1 sheet ready rolled puff pastry
1. Grease a muffin tray with butter, pop into the fridge, preheat your oven to 180C then start with the custard.
1. Mix the 2 yolks, full egg,  corn flour, vanilla and sugar. Mix well until mixture lightens in colour and sugar is given time to
dissolve
2. Heat the milk in a saucepan on a medium heat with lemon and cinnamon until just hot. Slowly add warmed milk bit by
bit to the egg mixture, whisking constantly so that the eggs doesn’t split.
3. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and heat until custard thickens. This should happen quite rapidly.
4. Once thickened, remove from heat, pour into a glass bowl, place cling film ON the surface of the custard so that it doesn’t
make a skin and chill.
5. In the meantime, cut pastry sheet into two pieces and place them on top of each other. Roll the pastry tightly, from the
short side, into a log and cut the log into 12 even sized discs.
6. Take each disk, and working on a lightly floured surface, roll each disk out into 10cm disks, and press the pastry into the
muffin tray
7. Once custard is cooled, scoop the custard into the pastry bases filling them just shy of the brim (about 3/4 full)
8. Pop the tray into the oven for 20-25 minutes until dark patches start appearing on the custard. The custard might rise, this
is ok, it will sink again.
9. Remove from oven. IF NECESSARY switch oven to high heat grill. Once oven is ready, pop them back in for 2-3 minutes to
finish giving them their dark patches and colouring.
10. Serve hot or cold, with a dusting of icing sugar and cinnamon if desired.
