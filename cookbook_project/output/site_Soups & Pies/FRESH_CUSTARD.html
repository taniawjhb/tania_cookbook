FRESH CUSTARD
INGREDIENTS
200ml double cream
700ml whole milk
4 large egg yolks
3 tbsp cornflour
80 - 100g caster sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
METHOD
STEP 1:  Put the cream and milk into a large pan and 
gently bring to just below boiling point. Meanwhile, in 
a large bowl, whisk the yolks, cornflour, sugar and 
vanilla. Gradually pour the hot milk mixture onto the 
sugar mixture, whisking constantly.
STEP 2:  Wipe out the saucepan and pour the mixture 
back into it. Heat gently, stirring with a wooden spoon 
(see Steps 1 and 2, for stirring tips) until the custard is 
thickened, but before any lumps form. Eat hot or cold.
