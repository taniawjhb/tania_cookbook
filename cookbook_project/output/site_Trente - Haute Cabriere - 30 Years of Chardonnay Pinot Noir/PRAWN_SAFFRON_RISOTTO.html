PRAWN & SAFFRON RISOTTO
1kg prawns, shell on, deveined and cleaned 
3tbsp butter
1/4 cup olive oil
2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
1 glass white wine 
Salt & pepper
8 cups prawn stock 
1/4 cup olive oil
1 medium onion, diced
1 stick of celery, finely chopped
1 carrot, finely chopped 
Large pinch of saffron
2 cups arborio rice
1 cup dry white wine
1 tablespoon flat leaf parsley, chopped 
4 tablespoons cold butter
Salt and pepper
1.  In a large heavybased saucepan, add the butter and olive oil. 
Place over a medium heat.  Once it is hot add the garlic and stir 
quickly.  Almost immediately add the prawns.  Add them in a 
single layer allowing them to colour, but NOT cook all the way 
through.
2.  As the prawns are cooked remove and set aside.  Once all 
the prawns have been cooked, remove their heads and shells. 
Reserve all the juices and shells.
3.  Return the pan to the heat, add half a roughly chopped 
onion, a small bunch of fresh celery leaf and stir to coat.
4.  Once the onion starts to soften add the white wine and 
deglaze the pan.  Now add back all the prawn shells and 
reserved juices.
5.  Add 2litres of a good quality light vegetable stock and 
simmer for 20-minutes, skimming off any foam that surfaces.
6.  Strain and use immediately, or allow to cool and freeze
1.  Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; add 
onion, carrot and celery and season with salt and pepper
2.  Add the rice and stir to coat with the oil; season with salt and 
pepper and cook until slightly translucent.
6.  The rice should be hot and sizzling, you should stir carefully to 
ensure it does not stick.
7 .  Add wine to the hot rice, the liquid should hiss and be quickly 
absorbed.  Stir gently until almost all the liquid has cooked off. 
Add hot stock and broth mixture, a ladleful at a time, completely 
stirring in the liquid each time.  Remember at this stage you are 
trying to coax the starches out the rice by gently and continuosly 
stirring.
8.  Keep adding broth as needed so there is always a 1/2cm 
liquid layer over the rice.
9.  After about 8 minutes add add the saffron which has been 
soaked in 2 tbsp warm water
10. After 15 to 20 minutes, the rice should be close to al dente.
11.  At this stage add the reserved prawn meat, cut into bite size 
hunks, and stir to combine well - the prawns will cook through in 
the heat of the rice.
12.  Taste and adjust seasoning
13.  Now cover the pan, and allow it to stand for 2-3minutes.
