PROVENCAL OLIVE TAPENADE
Intense and loaded with flavour!
1/2 cup pitted black olives, such as
Niçoise or oil-cured olives
1 tablespoon drained capers
2 drained oil-packed anchovy fillets
3 medium cloves garlic
5 basil leaves (optional)
1 tablespoon loosely packed fresh
oregano, marjoram, or thyme leaves
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon fresh juice from 1 lemon
Extra-virgin olive oil, as needed
Combine olives, capers, anchovies,
garlic, basil (if using), other herbs, and mustard in the work
bowl and process, scraping down the sides, until a finely
chopped paste forms. Process in lemon juice. With the
processor running, drizzle in just enough olive oil to loosen to
a spreadable paste, about 2 tablespoons. Season with salt
and pepper only if needed.
Roughly chop olives, capers,
anchovies, and garlic, then add to mortar with basil (if using) and
other herbs. Tap, crush, and smash with pestle until ingredients
have been reduced to a thick paste (a little chunkiness is okay).
Using pestle, work in mustard and lemon juice, then drizzle in
just enough olive oil to form a spreadable paste, about 2
tablespoons. Season with salt and pepper only if needed.
