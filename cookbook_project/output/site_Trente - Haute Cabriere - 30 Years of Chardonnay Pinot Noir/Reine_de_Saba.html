Reine de Saba
12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) butter, more for pan
180gms bittersweet chocolate, chopped into small pieces
A few drops almond extract
2 tablespoons strong coffee
4 large eggs, separated
Pinch of salt
1 cup sugar
1 Â¾ cups finely ground almonds
FOR THE GLAZE:
2 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon honey
120gms bittersweet chocolate, chopped into small pieces
1 tablespoon butter
Heat oven to 165C. Butter a 24cm springform pan, and line the side wall with parchment paper.
In a heavy-bottomed pan, combine 12 tablespoons butter, the chopped chocolate, almond extract and
coffee. Melt over low heat, then transfer to a bowl and allow to cool.
With an electric mixer, whisk egg whites and salt until soft peaks form. Slowly add 1/2 cup sugar until thick and
glossy. Set aside.
In a separate bowl, whisk together egg yolks with remaining 1/2 cup sugar until thick. Fold in the melted
chocolate mixture. Add ground almonds and mix well. Whisk in a dollop of egg whites to lighten mixture. Using
a rubber spatula, gently fold in the rest of egg whites, keeping batter airy.
Scrape batter into pan and bake until cake is dry on top and a bit gooey in center, 30 to 40 minutes. (After 30
minutes of baking, check center of cake with a tester or toothpick. If center seems very wet, continue baking.) Cool
cake on a rack for 20 minutes, then remove side of pan. Allow to continue cooling. Top of cake may crack as it
cools, but glaze will cover most cracking.
In a small saucepan, combine 2 tablespoons sugar, the honey and 1/4 cup water. Bring to a boil, then
remove from heat. Add 4 ounces chopped chocolate, swirl pan to mix, and allow to stand until melted, about 3
minutes.
Whisk 1 tablespoon butter into icing, then pour evenly over cake. Use a spatula to ease icing out to edges of
cake. Allow icing to cool, and set before slicing.
