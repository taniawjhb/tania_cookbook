<h1>QUICK FALAFEL</h1>

QUICK FALAFEL
1 can chickpeas (rinsed, drained and patted
dry)
1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 medium shallots (minced)
2 Tbsp raw sesame seeds
1 1/2 tsp cumin (plus more to taste)
1/4 tsp each sea salt and black pepper (plus
more to taste)
1 healthy pinch coriander (optional)
3-4 Tbsp all-purpose flour
3-4 Tbsp oil for cooking
Bread crumbs for coating
Add chickpeas, parsley, shallot, garlic, sesame seeds, cumin,
salt, pepper (and coriander and cardamom if using) to a food
processor or blender and mix/pulse to combine, scraping down
sides as needed until thoroughly combined. You’re looking for a
crumbly dough, not a paste.
Add flour 1 Tbsp at a time and
to combine until no longer
wet and you can mold the dough into a ball without it sticking to
your hands - about 4 Tbsp
Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. I added a bit more salt,
pepper, and a dash of coriander. You want the flavor to be pretty
bold, so don’t be shy.
Transfer to a mixing bowl, cover and refrigerate for 1-2 hours to
firm up. If you’re in a hurry you can chill in the freezer for 45
minutes or skip this step - but they will be a little more fragile
when cooking.
Once chilled, scoop out rounded Tablespoon amounts (~30 g in
weight // I used this scoop) and gently form into 11-12 small
discs (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering
batch size).
OPTIONAL: Sprinkle on panko bread crumbs and gently press to
adhere - flip and repeat. This will produce a crispier falafel, but
it's optional.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add enough oil to
generously coat the pan - about 2 Tbsp (30 ml). Swirl to coat.
Once the oil is hot, add only as many falafel as will fit very
comfortably in the pan at a time - about 5-7 .
Cook for a total of 4-5 minutes, flipping when the underside is
deep golden brown. Repeat until all falafel are browned - the
deeper golden brown they are, the crispier they'll be. They will
also firm up more once slightly cooled.
