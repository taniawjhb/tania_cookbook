SARAGLI
500 g granulated sugar
300 g water
1 stick(s) cinnamon
50 g glucose
6 cloves
peel, of 1 lemon
1 tablespoon(s) lemon juice
400 g butter
150 g walnuts
150 g almonds
1 teaspoon(s) cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon(s) cloves, ground
900 g phyllo dough sheet
pistachios, ground, to serve
The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.
1. In a pot, add the sugar, water, cinnamon stick, glucose syrup,
cloves and lemon rind.
2. Place pot over medium heat.
3. In about 2-3 minutes, as soon as the sugar melts, remove pot
from heat.
4. Add the lemon juice, stir and set aside to cool.
Melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat.
In a food processor or using a mortar and pestle, grind the
walnuts, almonds, cinnamon and cloves together. You don’t want to
finely grind them but you don’t want to have large pieces because
they will rip through the phyllo dough.
Transfer the filling to a bowl and transfer the melted butter
to a separate bowl.
Preheat the oven to 160* C (320* F) Fan.
Spread out the phyllo dough on a clean working surface.
Lay one sheet of phyllo dough separately on your working
surface. Drizzle with melted butter, making sure not to let the brush
directly touch the phyllo.
Cover with another sheet of phyllo and drizzle with butter.
Spread the filling over the entire surface.
Place two wooden sticks in the middle of the phyllo and roll
the smaller side towards the middle, leaving an empty space at the
edge.
Do not roll too tight and gently press the ends together
towards the middle with your hands, creating folds in the phyllo and
remove the sticks.
Brush a 30x40 cm baking pan with butter and add the
sargli.
Drizzle with butter immediately and repeat the same
process until the baking pan is full of saragli rolls.
When the pan is full, drizzle any leftover butter over the
sargli rolls.
Bake for 70-90 minutes.
When ready, remove from oven and immediately pour the
cool syrup over the scorching hot saragli rolls.
Allow them to soak up the syrup for 30 minutes.
Sprinkle with ground pistachio nuts and serve.
