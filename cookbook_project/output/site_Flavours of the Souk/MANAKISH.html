MANAKISH
2 tsp 
active dry yeast
300 ml water (warm)
500 g flour
2 tsp 
salt
2 tsp 
sugar
12 tbsp olive oil
6 tbsp Za'atar
300 g halloumi
lemon (for serving)
The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.
Dissolve yeast in lukewarm water. Add flour, salt, and sugar to a
bowl. Make a well and add yeast mixture, followed by one third of
the olive oil. Work into a dough using your hands and knead for 5
min. until elastic. The dough should spring back when poked with
your finger. Form dough into a ball, place in a large bowl, oil the top,
and cover with plastic wrap. Set aside somewhere warm for 1 hr.
Once the dough has risen, roll out into a log and divide into
4 equal pieces. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and press
out slightly into flatbreads. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let
rise again while you prepare the topping. Mix the Za’atar with
remaining olive oil. Grate halloumi on the largest side of a box
grater, then add to the Za’atar mixture and mix to combine.
Preheat oven to 200°C/400°F. Stretch out the flatbreads and
dimple the surfaces with your fingertips. Top each generously with
the Za’atar-halloumi mixture and drizzle more olive oil, if desired.
Transfer to oven and bake for approx. 8 min. Serve immediately with
lemon wedges. Enjoy!
