Add a few large handfuls of the spinach and cook,\ntossing gently with tongs. As the spinach starts to wilt, add the rest a few handfuls at a time. Cook until all the spinach is wilted and bright\ngreen, about 4 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the spinach to a colander set in a sink. Let cool slightly and squeeze with your hands\nto extract as much of the remaining liquid as you can.\nWipe the pan dry with a paper towel. Heat the oil in the pan over medium heat. Add the scallions and cook until soft and fragrant, about 4\nminutes. Stir in the spinach, turn off the heat, and let cool for 5 minutes. Then stir in the cheeses, eggs, dill, parsley, nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp.\nsalt and mix thoroughly.\nWith a pastry brush, lightly coat the bottom and sides of a 9x13x2-inch baking pan with some of the oil. Working quickly,\nlightly oil one side of a phyllo sheet and lay it in the pan oiled side up and off center so that it partially covers the bottom and reaches\nhalfway up one long side of the pan (the edge on the bottom of the pan will be about 1 inch from the side). Lightly oil the top of another\nphyllo sheet and lay it oiled side up and off center so it reaches halfway up the other long side of the pan. (If your pan has sloped sides,\nthe sheets may be slightly longer than the bottom of the pan; if so, let the excess go up one short side of the pan and then alternate with\nsubsequent sheets.) Repeat this pattern with 4 more phyllo sheets.\nNext, lightly oil the tops of 3 phyllo sheets and layer them oiled side up and centered in the pan. Spread the filling evenly over the last\nlayer.\nRepeat the oiling and layering of the remaining 9 phyllo sheets over the filling in the same way you layered the previous 9. With the oiled\nbristles of the pastry brush, push the edges of the phyllo down around the sides of the pan to enclose the filling completely.\nWith a sharp knife, score the top phyllo layer into 24 rectangles, being careful not to cut all the way through to the filling. Using the same\npastry brush, brush the milk along all the score marks (this will keep the phyllo from flaking up along the edges of the squares).

Dredge the rolled meatballs lightly in flour making sure to shake off any excess. Fry until nicely browned\non all sides.\nThe traditional way of cooking Greek meatballs (keftedes) is frying them. Fry the keftedes in batches of 10-15 at a\ntime, until nicely browned on all sides.\nInstead of frying you can bake / grill the keftedes in the oven. Preheat the oven at 200C, place the keftedes on\ngreased baking sheet about an inch apart. Bake for about 20 minutes, turning the meatballs upside down\nmidway through cooking time. The grilled version is much lighter than the fried so theres not excuse to not trying\nit now!\n"

Spread the filling evenly over the last layer.\nRepeat the oiling and layering of the remaining 9 phyllo sheets over the filling\nin the same way you layered the previous 9. With the oiled bristles of the pastry\nbrush, push the edges of the phyllo down around the sides of the pan to\nenclose the filling completely.\nWith a sharp knife, score the top phyllo layer into 24 rectangles, being careful\nnot to cut all the way through to the filling. Using the same pastry brush, brush\nthe milk along all the score marks (this will keep the phyllo from flaking up\nalong the edges of the squares). Bake the spanakopita until the top crust is\ngolden brown, 35 to 45 minutes. Let cool until just warm. Cut out the rectangles\ncarefully along the score marks and serve.\nMuska B\u00f6re\u011fi\n"

Wash the liver well \nwith water and place it in water and wine vinegar while the \nvegetables are browning ; this is to remove some of its \nflavor that not everyone loves. Brown the soffrito and then \nadd the minced meat and the rinsed chicken liver and the \nspoons of tomato preserve diluted in a ladle of hot broth. At \nthis point you can salt the meat.\nStep 3:  Continue cooking slowly and covered, for about 40 \nminutes, with a glass of red wine and, if this is not enough, \nadding a little broth.\nStep 4:  For the last 10 minutes, uncover the pot to thicken \nthe sauce, break up the liver with a fork and mix it all \ntogether.\nStep 5:  Now prepare the risotto, by placing the butter in a \nsaucepan and adding the finely chopped onion.\nStep 6:  When the browning process is finished, add the rice \nand toast for two minutes, stirring constantly with a wooden \nladle. Start by adding, little by little, the very hot meat broth, \nstirring often and keeping the flame on medium heat.\nStep 7:  Bring the rice up slowly, adding the broth little by \nlittle and letting it absorb before adding more.\nStep 8:  Once you have reached two thirds of the cooking \ntime, add about half of the meat sauce, which must be hot. \nWhen the rice is cooked, taste for salt and adjust if \nnecessary.\nStep 9:  Stir in the grated parmesan. Serve hot and, on top of \nthe risotto, put two good spoonfuls of the meat sauce. \nSprinkle with freshly ground pepper. It will also be delicious \nwith an aromatic pepper.\n"

Add a few large handfuls of the spinach and cook, \ntossing gently with tongs. As the spinach starts to wilt, add the rest a few handfuls at a time. Cook until all the spinach is wilted and bright \ngreen, about 4 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the spinach to a colander set in a sink. Let cool slightly and squeeze with your hands \nto extract as much of the remaining liquid as you can.\nWipe the pan dry with a paper towel. Heat the oil in the pan over medium heat. Add the scallions and cook until soft and fragrant, about 4 \nminutes. Stir in the spinach, turn off the heat, and let cool for 5 minutes. Then stir in the cheeses, eggs, dill, parsley, nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp. \nsalt and mix thoroughly.\nWith a pastry brush, lightly coat the bottom and sides of a 9x13x2-inch baking pan with some of the oil. Working quickly, \nlightly oil one side of a phyllo sheet and lay it in the pan oiled side up and off center so that it partially covers the bottom and reaches \nhalfway up one long side of the pan (the edge on the bottom of the pan will be about 1 inch from the side). Lightly oil the top of another \nphyllo sheet and lay it oiled side up and off center so it reaches halfway up the other long side of the pan. (If your pan has sloped sides, \nthe sheets may be slightly longer than the bottom of the pan; if so, let the excess go up one short side of the pan and then alternate with \nsubsequent sheets.) Repeat this pattern with 4 more phyllo sheets.\nNext, lightly oil the tops of 3 phyllo sheets and layer them oiled side up and centered in the pan. Spread the filling evenly over the last \nlayer.\nRepeat the oiling and layering of the remaining 9 phyllo sheets over the filling in the same way you layered the previous 9. With the oiled \nbristles of the pastry brush, push the edges of the phyllo down around the sides of the pan to enclose the filling completely.\nWith a sharp knife, score the top phyllo layer into 24 rectangles, being careful not to cut all the way through to the filling. Using the same \npastry brush, brush the milk along all the score marks (this will keep the phyllo from flaking up along the edges of the squares). Bake the \nspanakopita until the top crust is golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes. Let cool until just warm. Cut out the rectangles carefully along the score \nmarks and serve.\nThe Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.\n"

    "body": "Spanakopita\n1kg. fresh spinach, washed, dried, trimmed, and coarsely chopped\n3 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil\n1 bunch scallions (about 3 oz. or 10 small), white and light-green parts only, trimmed and finely chopped\n2 cups crumbled feta cheese (10 oz.)\n1/2 cup finely grated Greek kefalotyri cheese or Parmigiano-Reggiano\n2 large eggs, lightly beaten\n1/2 cup finely chopped fresh dill\n1/3 cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley\n1/4 tsp. freshly grated nutmeg\nKosher or fine sea salt\nFor the assembly:\n1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil for brushing; more as needed\nEighteen 9x14-inch sheets frozen phyllo dough, thawed and at room temperature\n2 tsp. milk\nTIP:\nHeat a 10-inch straight-sided saute pan over medium-high heat. Add a few large handfuls of the spinach and cook,\ntossing gently with tongs. As the spinach starts to wilt, add the rest a few handfuls at a time. Cook until all the spinach is wilted and bright\ngreen, about 4 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the spinach to a colander set in a sink. Let cool slightly and squeeze with your hands\nto extract as much of the remaining liquid as you can.\nWipe the pan dry with a paper towel. Heat the oil in the pan over medium heat. Add the scallions and cook until soft and fragrant, about 4\nminutes. Stir in the spinach, turn off the heat, and let cool for 5 minutes. Then stir in the cheeses, eggs, dill, parsley, nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp.\nsalt and mix thoroughly.\nWith a pastry brush, lightly coat the bottom and sides of a 9x13x2-inch baking pan with some of the oil. Working quickly,\nlightly oil one side of a phyllo sheet and lay it in the pan oiled side up and off center so that it partially covers the bottom and reaches\nhalfway up one long side of the pan (the edge on the bottom of the pan will be about 1 inch from the side). Lightly oil the top of another\nphyllo sheet and lay it oiled side up and off center so it reaches halfway up the other long side of the pan. (If your pan has sloped sides,\nthe sheets may be slightly longer than the bottom of the pan; if so, let the excess go up one short side of the pan and then alternate with\nsubsequent sheets.) Repeat this pattern with 4 more phyllo sheets.\nNext, lightly oil the tops of 3 phyllo sheets and layer them oiled side up and centered in the pan. Spread the filling evenly over the last\nlayer.\nRepeat the oiling and layering of the remaining 9 phyllo sheets over the filling in the same way you layered the previous 9. With the oiled\nbristles of the pastry brush, push the edges of the phyllo down around the sides of the pan to enclose the filling completely.\nWith a sharp knife, score the top phyllo layer into 24 rectangles, being careful not to cut all the way through to the filling. Using the same\npastry brush, brush the milk along all the score marks (this will keep the phyllo from flaking up along the edges of the squares). Bake the\nspanakopita until the top crust is golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes. Let cool until just warm. Cut out the rectangles carefully along the score\nmarks and serve.\nThe Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.\n"

Stir in the lukewarm milk and cream and then add the egg \nyolks and melted butter - Whisk to combine.\nSTEP 2:  In a large bowl whisk together the flour and salt.\nSTEP 3:   Pour the milk mixture over the dry ingredients and start \nkneading it until it pulls away from the edges of the bowl. Give the\ndough the shape of a ball. Sprinkle oil onto a clean bowl, place the \ndough and cover with plastic wrap. Let it rest for about 1 hour at room \ntemperature (warm space) until doubled in size.\nSTEP 4:  While the dough rises, add your vanilla extract to the soft butter \nand work it in, until the butter is light and creamy and the vanilla has \nbeen incorporated.  Set aside.  Combine cinnamon and brown sugar. \nSet aside.\nPreheat the oven to 190C.  Butter two 12 cup muffin tins, generously \nwith the reserved butter.  \nSTEP 6:  On a floured surface, using a rolling pin roll the dough to a \nsquare of 50 x 50 cm. Roll the dough gently allow the rolling pin to do \nthe work.  Then trim the pastry into a neat square.\nSTEP 7:  Dab the butter around the pastry and then spread it until you \nhave a thin, even layer about 2mm thick.  Now take your reserved \ncinnamon sugar and scatter it evenly over the entire piece of pastry.  \nVery gently with your hands smooth out the sugar so that the pastry is \nevenly coated.  Now gently press the sugar down into the butter.\nSTEP 8:  Measure your dough and then, measure a third of the way \nalong the pastry andcarefully fold the pastry.  Press down gently on the \nfolded half, now lift the pastry over again to close it, check to ensure it \nlines up evenly in thirds and press down again gently.\nSTEP 9:  Trim the open edges with a sharp knife coated in flour.  Now \ncut the pastry into 2.5cm strips.  Taking one strip at a time, gently pat \nthe strip flat, until it is nicely tightened.  With your sharp floured knife, cut \nthe pastry twice all the way through the bottom resulting in three even \nstrips.\nSTEP 10:  Now plait these strips all the way through and then take the \nclosed end and roll it inwards.  Place in a muffin cup.  Once all the \nstrips are plaited, beat your egg and glaze the tops of the buns lightly.\nSTEP 11:  Bake in the preheated oven for 25 - 30 minutes, until cooked \nthrough and nicely golden.  Allow to cool for a few minutes in the tin \nand then carefully remove to a cooling rack.\nSTEP 12:  Once warm dust with icing sugar or a runny icing glaze for a \ndecadent treat drizzle them whilst warm with a warm caramel sauce.\n"

Add a few large handfuls of the spinach and cook, \ntossing gently with tongs. As the spinach starts to wilt, add the rest a few handfuls at a time. Cook until all the spinach is wilted and bright \ngreen, about 4 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the spinach to a colander set in a sink. Let cool slightly and squeeze with your hands \nto extract as much of the remaining liquid as you can.\nWipe the pan dry with a paper towel. Heat the oil in the pan over medium heat. Add the scallions and cook until soft and fragrant, about 4 \nminutes. Stir in the spinach, turn off the heat, and let cool for 5 minutes. Then stir in the cheeses, eggs, dill, parsley, nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp. \nsalt and mix thoroughly.\nWith a pastry brush, lightly coat the bottom and sides of a 9x13x2-inch baking pan with some of the oil. Working quickly, \nlightly oil one side of a phyllo sheet and lay it in the pan oiled side up and off center so that it partially covers the bottom and reaches \nhalfway up one long side of the pan (the edge on the bottom of the pan will be about 1 inch from the side). Lightly oil the top of another \nphyllo sheet and lay it oiled side up and off center so it reaches halfway up the other long side of the pan. (If your pan has sloped sides, \nthe sheets may be slightly longer than the bottom of the pan; if so, let the excess go up one short side of the pan and then alternate with \nsubsequent sheets.) Repeat this pattern with 4 more phyllo sheets.\nNext, lightly oil the tops of 3 phyllo sheets and layer them oiled side up and centered in the pan. Spread the filling evenly over the last \nlayer.\nRepeat the oiling and layering of the remaining 9 phyllo sheets over the filling in the same way you layered the previous 9. With the oiled \nbristles of the pastry brush, push the edges of the phyllo down around the sides of the pan to enclose the filling completely.\nWith a sharp knife, score the top phyllo layer into 24 rectangles, being careful not to cut all the way through to the filling. Using the same \npastry brush, brush the milk along all the score marks (this will keep the phyllo from flaking up along the edges of the squares). Bake the \nspanakopita until the top crust is golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes. Let cool until just warm. Cut out the rectangles carefully along the score \nmarks and serve.\nThe Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.\n"

Bring back to the boil and simmer for 10-\n15 minutes until just soft (will depend on th size of your potatoes). Test with a knife \u2013 the potatoes should be\ncooked, but not overcooked, otherwise the they will be mushy and will have absorbed too much water. Hold\nthem in a dish cloth to peel as they will be hot.\nUsing a mouli/potato ricer/sieve press the potatoes into a bowl or onto a clean work surface. Make a hollow in\nyour pile of potatoes, then pour in the egg and sprinkle over half the flour. Start to blend everything with your\nhands, adding more flour but as little as you can get away with. Work carefully and quickly, as the more you\nhandle the dough, the harder and bouncier it will become. You need the same lightness you would use for\npastry.\nYou should now have a soft dough that holds together, doesn\u2019t feel sticky and can be easily shaped.\nDivide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Roll a piece at a time into long, thumb-nail thick cylinders on a lightly\nfloured surface, again working lightly and quickly. As you roll you will also be gently stretching the dough. Keep\nthe surface well floured as you don\u2019t want the gnocchi to stick.\nCut the dough into thumb-nail long lengths. To score the gnocchi use the back of a fork pressed against the\ngnocchi. This will help to carry the sauce that you use, it is not ssential however.\nBring a large, deep pot of salted water to the boil. Working with a few at a time, drop in the gnocchi and listen for\nthe wonderful kissing noise they make as they go in. Let them cook for 2 minutes, during which time they will\nbob back up to the surface, then scoop them out with a slotted spoon. Taste - they should be soffic\u00ed e leggeri\n(soft and light), the gnocchi equivalent of al dente.\n"

Cover with a piece of plastic wrap, and \nwith a mallet or rolling pin, gently pound it until it is of an even \nthickness.\nStep 4:  Spread the stuffing in a line along the center of the \nmeat. Bring the edges of the meat together to return it to its \noriginal shape. Secure with toothpicks.\nStep 5:  Lay out the bacon slices on a cutting board, \noverlapping them slightly. Place the tenderloin on top with the \ntoothpicks facing up. Removing the toothpicks as you work, \nwrap the bacon slices around the pork to form a log. Place \nthe tenderloin, bacon seam side down, on the baking sheet.\nStep 6:  Roast for 20 to 25 minutes. If the roast is ready before \nthe bacon browns, place the tenderloin under the broiler for 3 \nto 5 minutes to brown the bacon.\nStep 7:  Let the tenderloin rest for 10 minutes before cutting \ninto slices:\nStep 8:  Serve with the pan juices spooned over top if desired.\n"

Bring back to the boil and simmer for 10-15 minutes until \njust soft (will depend on th size of your potatoes). Test with a \nknife \u2013 the potatoes should be cooked, but not overcooked, \notherwise the they will be mushy and will have absorbed too \nmuch water. Hold them in a dish cloth to peel as they will be \nhot.\nUsing a mouli/potato ricer/sieve press the potatoes into a bowl \nor onto a clean work surface. Make a hollow in your pile of \npotatoes, then pour in the egg, salt & nutmeg and sprinkle over \nhalf the flour. Start to blend everything with your hands, adding \nmore flour but as little as you can get away with.  Work carefully \nand quickly, as the more you handle the dough, the harder and \nbouncier it will become. You need the same lightness you would \nuse for pastry.\nYou should now have a soft dough that holds together, doesn\u2019t \nfeel sticky and can be easily shaped.\nDivide the dough into 3 equal pieces. Roll a piece at a time into \nlong, thumb-nail thick cylinders on a lightly floured surface, again \nworking lightly and quickly. As you roll you will also be gently \nstretching the dough. Keep the surface well floured as you don\u2019t \nwant the gnocchi to stick.\nCut the dough into thumb-nail long lengths. To score the gnocchi \nuse the back of a fork pressed against the gnocchi.  This will \nhelp to carry the sauce that you use, it is not ssential however.\nBring a large, deep pot of salted water to the boil. Working with a \nfew at a time, drop in the gnocchi and listen for the wonderful \nkissing noise they make as they go in. Let them cook for 2 \nminutes, during which time they will bob back up to the surface, \nthen scoop them out with a slotted spoon. Taste - they should \nbe soffic\u00ed e leggeri (soft and light), the gnocchi equivalent of al \ndente.\n"
