CHICKEN FRICASEE
A classic of chicken in a light cream and herb sauce!
1 Tbsp olive oil
8 chicken thighs and legs combined
salt and pepper to taste
1 Tbsp butter
1 small onion chopped
2 cloves garlic minced
2 carrots cut in large pieces
3-4 sprigs thyme (leaves only)
2 Tbsp all-purpose flour
1/2 cup dry white wine such as Sauvignon
Blanc
1 1/2 cup chicken stock
1/2 cup heavy cream
Preheat oven to 180C. Pat dry chicken with a paper
towel and season with salt and pepper. Place a large deep pan
over medium/high heat with 1 Tbsp olive oil. Brown chicken
approximately 4 minutes per side until golden on each side but
not cooked through. Remove to a plate and set aside until
needed. Discard excess fat leaving 1 Tbsp in the pan.
Add 1 Tbsp butter to the pan and saute chopped onions
and carrots over low heat for 7-10 minutes. Add minced garlic
and fresh thyme leaves and cook briefly for 30 seconds. Add 2
Tbsp flour and cook while stirring until flour is completely
absorbed by the fat and mixture smells nutty. Add 1/2 cup white
wine and simmer until slightly reduced. Pour in 1 1/2 cups
chicken stock.
Return chicken to the pan together with the juices and
bake uncovered at 180C for 45 minutes.
Take the chicken out of the oven and add 1/2 cup
heavy cream, stir until combined. Taste and season with salt if
needed.
