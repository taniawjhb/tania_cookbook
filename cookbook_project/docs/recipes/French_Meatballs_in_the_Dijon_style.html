French Meatballs in the Dijon style
700 gms ground beef
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 cup parsley/thyme/sage leaves, finely minced
2 minced garlic cloves
1 egg
1/2  cup vegetable oil
1 cup finely minced onion (about 1/2 large onion)
1/2 cup dry white wine
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
In a mixing bowl, we combined the beef, salt and pepper, parsley garlic and egg. We mixed it all well together and shaped the meat into
12 meatballs.
In heavy pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat until the vegetable oil shimmers.   We cooked the meatballs, about 3 minutes
on each side, until they were light brown. The meatballs won’t stick to the pan, because you’re using so much oil (and more fat will be
rendered from the meatballs). Fortunately, most of that fat gets poured off.
Once the meatballs are browned off remove and add keep warm
Once all thee meatballs are cooked, remove most of the oil from the pan then add the finely chopped onion. Let the onions cook over
medium heat until tender, but not brown, about 3 minutes. Then add the wine and let it all simmer and cook down a bit.
Now whisk in the Dijon mustard once it is amalgamated whisk in the cream, and then add back the meatballs.  Cook the meatballs in the
cream over medium heat, uncovered, about  5 minutes, or until the cream had reduced by about 1/3.  Cover the pan and simmer on a
low flame until the meatballs are cooked through.
