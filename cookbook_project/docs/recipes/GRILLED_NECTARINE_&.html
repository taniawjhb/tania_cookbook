GRILLED NECTARINE &
MOZARELLA SALAD
15g unsalted butter
2 tbsp caster sugar
50g whole pecans
3 ripe nectarines, stoned and cut into eighths
lengthways
4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for
brushing
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 tsp honey
2 x 100g balls of fresh mozarella
70g rocket
bunch of basil leaves, roughly torn
pinch of chilli flakes
Heat the butter and sugar in a small frying pan over a medium
heat until the butter has melted. Add the pecans and stir to coat
in the buttery sugar. Continue to cook for about 5 mins, stirring
until the pecans are crisp and caramelised. Tip out onto a sheet
of baking parchment and leave to cool. Once cooled, roughly
chop and set aside.
Heat a griddle pan over a high heat and generously brush the
nectarine slices with some olive oil. Griddle for 1-2 mins on each
side until charred and caramelised. Remove to a serving platter
and set aside.
Whisk the 4 tbsp olive oil, vinegar and honey together with some
seasoning to make a dressing.
Scatter the rocket and basil across the base of your serving plate,
then nestle the charrred nectarine before tearing the balls of
mozzarella and dotting across the salad. Drizzle over the
dressing, scatter with the pecans and sprinkle with a pinch of
chilli flakes to serve.
