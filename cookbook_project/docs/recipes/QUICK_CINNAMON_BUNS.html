QUICK CINNAMON BUNS
DOUGH
480g cake flour, sifted
1 tsp salt
177ml lukewarm milk
90ml lukewarm cream
50g sugar
23 g fresh yeast (1 1/2 envelope active dry yeast)
90 g melted butter
2 egg yolk
1 tsp vanilla extract
FOR THE TOPPING:
160g softened butter
180g soft dark sugar
6 tsp finely ground cinnamon
1 tsp vanilla extract
STEP 1:  In a medium bowl stir fresh yeast with 2 tbsp of the sugar until 
it liquefies. Stir in the lukewarm milk and cream and then add the egg 
yolks and melted butter - Whisk to combine.
STEP 2:  In a large bowl whisk together the flour and salt.
STEP 3:   Pour the milk mixture over the dry ingredients and start 
kneading it until it pulls away from the edges of the bowl. Give the
dough the shape of a ball. Sprinkle oil onto a clean bowl, place the 
dough and cover with plastic wrap. Let it rest for about 1 hour at room 
temperature (warm space) until doubled in size.
STEP 4:  While the dough rises, add your vanilla extract to the soft butter 
and work it in, until the butter is light and creamy and the vanilla has 
been incorporated.  Set aside.  Combine cinnamon and brown sugar. 
Set aside.
Preheat the oven to 190C.  Butter two 12 cup muffin tins, generously 
with the reserved butter.  
STEP 6:  On a floured surface, using a rolling pin roll the dough to a 
square of 50 x 50 cm. Roll the dough gently allow the rolling pin to do 
the work.  Then trim the pastry into a neat square.
STEP 7:  Dab the butter around the pastry and then spread it until you 
have a thin, even layer about 2mm thick.  Now take your reserved 
cinnamon sugar and scatter it evenly over the entire piece of pastry.  
Very gently with your hands smooth out the sugar so that the pastry is 
evenly coated.  Now gently press the sugar down into the butter.
STEP 8:  Measure your dough and then, measure a third of the way 
along the pastry andcarefully fold the pastry.  Press down gently on the 
folded half, now lift the pastry over again to close it, check to ensure it 
lines up evenly in thirds and press down again gently.
STEP 9:  Trim the open edges with a sharp knife coated in flour.  Now 
cut the pastry into 2.5cm strips.  Taking one strip at a time, gently pat 
the strip flat, until it is nicely tightened.  With your sharp floured knife, cut 
the pastry twice all the way through the bottom resulting in three even 
strips.
STEP 10:  Now plait these strips all the way through and then take the 
closed end and roll it inwards.  Place in a muffin cup.  Once all the 
strips are plaited, beat your egg and glaze the tops of the buns lightly.
STEP 11:  Bake in the preheated oven for 25 - 30 minutes, until cooked 
through and nicely golden.  Allow to cool for a few minutes in the tin 
and then carefully remove to a cooling rack.
STEP 12:  Once warm dust with icing sugar or a runny icing glaze for a 
decadent treat drizzle them whilst warm with a warm caramel sauce.
