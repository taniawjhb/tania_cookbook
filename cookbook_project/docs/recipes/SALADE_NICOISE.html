<pre>
For the salad
8 new potatoes
50g green beans (or a small handful), 
trimmed and halved
3 eggs
2 Little Gem lettuces, quartered
50g pitted black olives
2 medium tomatoes (plum are good), 
quartered
145g can tuna in olive oil, drained, oil reserved 
(see below)
For the dressing
½ garlic clove
1 anchovy fillet (optional)
1 tbsp Dijion mustard
2 tbsp red wine vinegar
4 tbsp reserved olive oil from the tuna can 
(topped up, if needed)
STEP 1
To make the dressing, mash the garlic and 
anchovy, if using, with a small pinch of salt on a 
board using the blade of a large knife, or in a 
pestle and mortar. Combine the paste with the 
mustard and vinegar, then slowly stir in the tuna 
oil. Set aside.
STEP 2
Tip the new potatoes into a large pan of cold 
salted water, ensuring they’re well covered. Bring to 
the boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Add the 
beans and cook for 5 mins, then remove with a 
slotted spoon and immediately plunge into a bowl 
of iced water to cool. Cook the potatoes for another 
5 mins until tender, then drain and leave to cool. 
When cool enough to handle, halve or quarter 
them, and toss in a large bowl with 1 tbsp of the 
dressing. Leave to cool completely.
STEP 3
Meanwhile, cook the eggs in a second pan of 
simmering water for 7½ mins, then transfer to a 
bowl of iced water to cool. Drain the beans and 
eggs, then peel and halve the eggs.
STEP 4
Tip the lettuce quarters, cooked beans and olives 
into the bowl with the potatoes. Add most of the 
remaining dressing and gently toss. Divide the 
salad between two bowls, and top with the 
tomatoes and eggs. Flake over the tuna, then 
drizzle with the rest of the dressing and season.
