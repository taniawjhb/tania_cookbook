Pasteis de Bacalhau
What Portuguese menu would be complete without cod fish!
250 g boiled bacalhau
300 g potatoes, boiled with skin on
2 tbsp milk
2 eggs
1 onion, fine chopped
Half cup chopped parsley
1tsp paprika
Black pepper & salt to taste
Fine sliced red chilli (optional)
Method
1. Take your frozen bacalhau and submerge in water for 2-3 days (depending on flavour), changing the water half-daily
2. Put your potatoes on to boil for 35 min with skin on. Then boil the bacalhau in water for 15-20 minutes (depending on
size), adding 1 bayleaf to the water (this helps with surviving the smell)
3. Once boiled, remove skin and ALL bones, then shred the fish into tiny fibres using a pestle and mortar (Its quite a task, but
worth it as my mom always said)
4. Peel your cooked potatoes, then mash them. DO NOT USE A FOOD PROCESSOR.
5. Add your shredded fish, potatoes, chopped parsley, diced onion, paprika and chilli then stir well. Add your eggs one at a
time, stirring as you do.
6. Shape your uncooked fritters with two dessert spoons, then shallow fry them in quite a bit of oil, turning them every minute
or so.
7. Once golden throughout, remove and drain on some kitchen paper.
