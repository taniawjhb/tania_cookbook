CHILI CUMIN BURGER
500g minced beef
30g dried breadcrumbs
3 - 4 tbsp chilli cumin marinade mini 
bread rolls
4 tbsp chili mayo
3 plum tomatoes, sliced
4 tsp chimichurri marinade
Salt and black pepper
First make the burgers: place beef mince and breadcrumbs in a large bowl, add chili and cumin marinade, 
season with salt and pepper and mix well. Divide the mine into equal size portions (around golf ball sized), then 
flatten into patties and refrigerate to firm them up
Heat a griddle pan to very hot, then reduce heat to medium. Lightly oil both sides of your patties, and cook for 4 
minutes a side (make sure to brown the patty). Remove from heat and let stand for a few minutes (You can opt to 
do this on a braai following the same procedure)
Slice, brush lightly with olive oil and toast the burger buns. In the meanwhile, warm up the black beans in a pan
To assemble, put the bottom halves of the buns onto a serving plate. Spread the top halves with chili mayo. 
Arrange sliced tomato on the bun bases and place a burger on top. Spoon a little chimichurri marinade, followed 
by a tablespoon of black beans (optional). Close the burger and serve immediately
