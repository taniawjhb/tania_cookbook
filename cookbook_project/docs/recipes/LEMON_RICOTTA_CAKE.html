<pre>
¾ cup butter, softened 
1 ½ cups sugar
500gms whole milk ricotta cheese
3 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 large lemon, zested and juiced
½ teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon salt
1 ½ cups flour
powdered sugar for dusting top of cake
(optional)
Preheat oven to 175C. Grease a 24cm springform pan
using butter and powdered sugar; set aside.
In a large mixing bowl or stand up mixer, cream together the butter
and sugar until combined. Add in the ricotta cheese and blend until
light and fluffy, about 4 to 5 minutes.
Mix in the eggs, one at a time. Add in the vanilla, lemon zest, and
lemon juice and mix to combine. In the same bowl, stir in the
baking soda and salt. Lastly, add in the flour and mix until just
combined, scraping down the sides of bowl to full incorporate all of
the ingredients.
Pour the batter into the prepared springform pan. Bake for 45-55
minutes, or until the cake is set and a toothpick inserted in the
middle of the cake comes out clean.
Let cool in pan for 15 minutes before removing the collar and base
of the pan. Cool on a wire rack and dust with powdered sugar
before serving.
