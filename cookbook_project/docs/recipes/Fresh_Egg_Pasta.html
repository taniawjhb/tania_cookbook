Fresh Egg Pasta
300g 00” Flour
3 large eggs (Free Range)
30ml Olive Oil
Pinch of salt
Mound the flour on a work surface and make a well in the center
Break the eggs into the well, adding your pinch of salt and the olive oil. Using a fork, start whisking the eggs and oil
together, incorporating
a little flour as you do. Slowly blend the flour and eggs, working from the center outwards
Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 6 minutes, or until dough is smooth, soft, elastic but dry to the touch. If sticky,
add a little
more flour. Once correct texture is reached, cover in plastic wrap and allow to rest for 30 minutes,
