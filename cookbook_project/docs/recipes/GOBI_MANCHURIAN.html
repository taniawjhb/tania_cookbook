<pre>
250 grams cauliflower
florets (gobi cleaned)
½ cup all-purpose flour
(maida, prefer organic or at least unbleached)
¼ cup cornstarch
(white corn flour or yellow corn flour)
½ to 1 teaspoon red chilli powder
or paste (less spicy variety) (optional)
¼ teaspoon black pepper crushed or ground
¼ teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
½ cup water (more if needed)
Oil  for deep frying as needed
1½ tablespoons oil
1 tablespoon garlic finely chopped
½ tablespoon ginger finely chopped
1 green chili chopped (optional)
⅓ cup onions or spring onions finely chopped
¼ cup bell pepper
(capsicum chopped finely) (optional)
1 tablespoon soya sauce
2 to 3 tablespoon Red Chilli sauce
1 to 2 tablespoon tomato ketchup
(optional, use if using hot sauce)
½ teaspoon Red chili powder
½ tablespoon rice wine vinegar
1 teaspoon sugar (adjust to taste)
Salt as needed
3 to 4 tablespoons water
½ to ¾ teaspoon black pepper crushed or
ground
⅛ teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
2 tablespoons spring onion greens chopped for
garnish
1. Clean 250 grams of gobi and cut the florets to medium size.
2. Add them to 3 cups of hot water and rest for 5 minutes.
3. Later drain the gobi completely to a colander or spread on a clean
cloth until no moisture remains on the gobi.
4. You can do this ahead and set aside. Any moisture in the gobi will
cook it to soft and not crisp.
5. Heat up the oil for deep frying on a medium heat.
6. Meanwhile make the batter by adding cornstarch, all-purpose flour,
red chilli powder, black pepper and salt to a mixing bowl.
7. Mix and add water little by little as needed and make a free flowing
lump free batter. The consistency has to be medium and not too thick
or very runny. Adjust salt as needed by tasting the batter.
8. Then add the gobi florets to the batter in batches, coat them well.
1. When the oil turns hot enough, check by dropping a small amount of
batter to the hot oil. The batter has to rise without browning. This is the
correct temperature.
2. Pick up each cauliflower floret with a spoon or fingers & gently drop
them one by one to the hot oil. The flame has to be medium initially
and should be increased slightly as more gobi is added. Reduce the
flame to medium and fry until the florets turn golden and crisp. Keep
stirring in between for even frying.
3. Drain them to a kitchen tissue or a steel colander. Repeat the same
steps of adding the rest of the cauliflower florets to the batter, coating
them well and then frying them in hot oil until crisp.
4. For extra crisp gobi manchurian, you can also refry the once fried
gobi again in oil.
1. Mix together red chili powder with little water to a paste and keep
aside. This step is optional and is used mainly for the red color.
2. Heat 1½ tablespoons oil in a wide pan.
3. When the oil turns hot, add garlic, ginger and green chilies. Saute for
a minute or two.
4. Then add spring onions & capsicum. Saute them on a high flame for
2 mins.
5. Add soya sauce, red chili sauce, tomato ketchup, red chili paste,
sugar and vinegar.
6. Mix and add water. Mix and cook stirring and add pepper.
7. Cook on a medium heat until the sauce thickens.
8. Turn off the stove and check the taste.
9. The sauce has to be slightly sour, sweet & hot. If needed you can
adjust the salt & add more sauces as well.
10. Allow the sauce to cool for 1 to 2 mins.
11. Add the fried cauliflower and stir gently to coat the gobi well with
the manchurian sauce.
12. Garnish gobi manchurian with spring onion greens.
13. Serve immediately as a appetizer or as a side with noodles or fried
rice
