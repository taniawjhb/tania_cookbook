EMPANADAS
INGREDIENTS
375 g plain/all-purpose flour
175g cold unsalted butter , cut into 1 cm 
cubes
1 tsp cooking/kosher salt
1 egg yolk
125 ml warm milk , full fat (30 sec 
microwave)
EMPANADA FILLING:
1 1/2 tbsp olive oil
1/2 onion , finely chopped
1 garlic cloves , minced
300g beef mince
120g chorizo
2 tsp tomato paste
1 tsp fresh thyme , finely chopped
1/2 tsp dried oregano
1/2tsp cumin
1/2 tsp paprika
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
1/4 tsp salt
180 ml chicken stock
125 ml tomato passata
150g potato peeled, cut into 8mm cubes
1/3 cup green onion , finely sliced
METHOD
STEP 1:  Roughly chop chorizo into small pieces. Blitz 
using a food processor until it becomes a paste
STEP 2:  Heat oil in a large non stick pan over high 
heat. Cook onion and garlic for 2 minutes.
STEP 3:  Add chorizo and cook for 2 minutes. Add 
beef and cook until you no longer see raw beef. Add 
tomato paste and cook for 1 minute. Then add 
everything else except green onion, then stir.
STEP 4:  Bring to a simmer then lower heat so it's 
simmering gently. Cook for 15 minutes, stirring every 
now and then. Goal – juicy but not watery filling, with 
cooked potato.
STEP 5:  Stir through green onion. Transfer to bowl and 
fully cool before using (about 2 hours).
EMPANADA SHORTCRUST PASTRY:
STEP 1:  Whisk milk and yolk in a small jug. Pulse 
flour, salt and butter in a food processor until the 
butter becomes fine crumbs – largest lumps no 
bigger than peas (~ 4 to 6 times). Add egg-milk 
mixture, then blitz on low until it comes together into 
a ball of dough – about 10 seconds. (Note 2 for hand 
method)
STEP 2:  Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface, 
then bring together into a smooth log ~20cm long. 
Cut in half, shape into 2cm thick round discs. Wrap in 
cling wrap then refrigerate 30 - 1 hour minutes 
STEP 3:  Place one chilled disc on a lightly floured 
work surface. Roll out to 3 mm thickness. Cut 15 cm 
rounds, or other size as desired. Keep covered in the 
fridge, stacked on paper, as you continue to roll and 
cut. You should get 10 or 11 rounds.
MAKE EMPANADAS:
Preheat oven to 220°C/425°F (200°C fan).
Filling – Filling should be cold but spreadable (Note
