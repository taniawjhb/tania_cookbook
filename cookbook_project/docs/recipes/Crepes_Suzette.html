Crepes Suzette
100g plain flour
1 tbsp golden caster sugar
2 large eggs
1 tbsp sunflower oil
300ml semi-skimmed milk
splash of beer, about 2 tbsp (optional)
To make the sauce for crepes suzette
100g butter
100g golden caster sugar
150ml freshly squeezed orange juice (about 12 large oranges)
2 tsp finely grated orange zest
1 tsp finely grated lemon zest
3 tbsp Grand Marnier
2 tbsp cognac
Put the flour, sugar and a pinch of salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre, add the eggs, oil and 2 tbsp of
the milk, and beat together with a wooden spoon until smooth. Slowly start to pour in a little milk, mixing as you
pour, to keep the batter smooth. Pour in the rest of the milk, a bit more quickly now, until it looks like single cream.
Finally, add the beer.
Heat a 15cm/6in crêpe pan. Measure 21⁄2 tbsp of the batter into a jug, then pour into the pan, moving it around
so the mixture swirls and fits the bottom of the pan. When the crêpe is golden underneath (in about 15 seconds
if pan is the right temperature), turn and cook for a further 30 seconds, until spotted brown.
Slide the crêpe on to a plate. Wipe the pan with oiled kitchen paper and continue frying until all the batter is
used, stacking the crêpes on top of each other as you cook them.
For the sauce, heat the butter and sugar in a deep frying pan (about 25cm/10in) over a low heat, stirring
occasionally, until the sugar begins to dissolve; turn up the heat and bubble quite fast, until the mixture just starts
to go brown and caramelise (about 4 minutes), stirring only towards the end. Pour in the orange juice (see left);
add the orange and lemon zests, letting the mixture bubble for 3-4 minutes to thicken slightly. Add the Grand
Marnier and cognac, heat for a few seconds and lower the heat.
Put one crêpe into the juices and, holding it with a fork, coat it well in the mixture. Fold it into quarters and push
to one side of the pan. Continue the coating and folding with the remaining pancakes. Serve 2-3 crêpes per
person with the sauce.am.
