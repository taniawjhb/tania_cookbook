PORK TENDERLOIN WITH
APPLES & SAGE
700gms boneless pork tenderloin
1-2 tbsp olive oil
2 tsp chopped sage
salt and pepper
1 Gala apple core removed and cut into chunks
with the skin on
1/2 a yellow onion diced
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 cup apple jam
Preheat the oven to 180C. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a cast-iron
skillet over high heat. Carefully place the pork tenderloin into the pan
and cook each side for approximately 3 to 4 minutes, or until each side
is nicely browned.
Lower the heat to medium-low. Remove the tenderloin from the pan,
temporarily placing it on a plate. Add a generous pinch of salt to both
sides of the tenderloin, as well as a small pinch of freshly ground
pepper; set aside.
To the pan, add another tablespoon of oil (if needed). Add the apple
chunks and diced onion. Give everything a stir and sauté for a couple
of minutes until the onions turn translucent. Pour in 1 tablespoon of
balsamic vinegar and again stir everything together. Remove the skillet
from the heat.
Gently push aside the apple chunks and onions to clear a space in the
middle of the pan for the pork tenderloin. Transfer the tenderloin back
into the pan, pouring its residual juices on the plate in as well.
Warm the apple jam for 30 seconds in the microwave, then add a
tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to it. Stir in the vinegar until its
incorporated, then smear the jam all over the pork tenderloin. Sprinkle
the chopped sage over the entire contents of the pan.
Cover the skillet with a sheet of foil, then bake the tenderloin for 20
minutes, stopping to remove the sheet of foil. Bake for another 10 to 20
minutes, until it registers at least 165°F on a meat thermometer. Once
it's done baking, let the tenderloin rest for at least 5 minutes before
slicing on the diagonal and serving.
