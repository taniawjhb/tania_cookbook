INGREDIENTS
500G chicken breasts / deboned thighs, cut 
into bite-sized pieces
wood skewers (optional)
Chipotle Marinade:
1 1/2 tablespoon honey
1 chipotle pepper in adobo, minced
1 clove garlic, grated
1/2 Tbsp chili powder
1 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp paprika, preferably smoked paprika
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp onion powder
1/4 tsp dried oregano
Pinch red pepper flakes, optional
1 orange, zest and juice (1–2 teaspoons 
zest and 1 tablespoon juice)
1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
1 tablespoon sunflower oil
INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  If using wooden skewers, start by soaking the 
skewers in water for 15-30 minutes while you prep the 
chicken.
Step 2:  In a bowl combine all the ingredients for the 
marinade, mix well and give it a taste, adjust seasoning if 
needed.  Then using your hands or tongs, mix the chicken 
with the chipotle mix. It’ll look very saucy and a bit messy, but 
in the best possible way
Step 3:  Thread the chicken pieces onto skewers (usually I get 
4 skewers with a pound of chicken).
Step 4:  Grill the skewers until charred and cooked through, if 
using fillet be careful to not overcook them.  Finish with a 
drizzle of honey, and if using chicken fillet a brush of melted 
butter to add to the juiciness.
