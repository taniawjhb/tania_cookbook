FOR THE DOUGH
500g 00 Flour
350g caster sugar
280g raw almonds, in skin
80g butter
150g whole eggs + 2 egg yolks
1 tsp baking powder
Zest of 1 Orange
Large pinch of salt
FOR GLAZING
1 egg (or if you had any egg left over from 
measuring your 150g you can use this)
Instructions
Step 1: Preheat the oven to 180C.  Now spread your almonds 
out in a pan, and bake for 15 minutes until lightly golden and 
fragrant.  Remove and set aside to cool.  Reduce the oven to 
175C.
Step 2: While your nuts are roasting, melt your butter in a small 
pan, once melted remove from the heat and add your orange 
zest and allow to cool.
Step 3: In the bowl of a stand mixer, or in a large bowl add 
your eggs and caster sugar.  Whip with the whisk attachment 
for at least 10 minutes to make a light and airy mixture.  Don’t 
rush this step.  
Step 4: Once the eggs are beaten, add your cooled orange 
butter, salt and the almonds to the mixture, mix well to 
combine.
Step 5: Sieve your flour and baking powder into the bowl with 
your egg and butter mixture.  If you are using a stand mixer 
swap to the paddle attachement, and mix until a slightly 
sticky dough forms.
Step 6:  Lightly flour a surface and then divide your dough into 
3 equal parts, approx 450g each, now shape into 3 equal 
loaves about 30cm long, work lightly so that you do not need 
to add too much extra flour.
Step 7: Place your loaves on lined baking sheets, and bake in 
the preheated oven for about 30 minutes or until the surface 
is golden.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly.  
Reduce the oven to 160C.
Step 8:  Now cut the loaves into slices about 1 finger thick.  
Place the slices back onto the baking sheet, return to the oven 
for 10 minutes, remove and flip the cantucci and repeat for a 
further 10 minutes, until the biscuits are golden and crunchy.  
Remove and allow to cool.
