TENDERSTEM BROCOLLI 
WITH CITRUS & ALMONDS
300gms tender stem brocolli
1 orange
1/4 cup olive oil
3 cloves garlic
1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
1/4 cup flaked almonds
salt
INSTRUCTIONS
1.  Fill a large saucepan with 1 inch water and fit 
with a steamer basket (or fill a large pot with 1/2 
inch water). Bring to a simmer. Place the broccoli 
in the steamer basket or saucepan (if using 
broccoli, cut into large florets), cover, and steam 
until just tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a 
platter.
2.  Meanwhile, using a vegetable peeler, remove 3 
strips of orange zest; thinly slice the zest.
3.  In a small saucepan, heat the oil, garlic, and 
red pepper over low heat until the garlic is just 
golden, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl.
4.  Squeeze 2 tablespoons orange juice into the 
bowl. Add the zest and 1/2 teaspoon salt and stir 
to combine.  Spoon over the broccoli.
