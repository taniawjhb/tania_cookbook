RASPBERRY FLAPJACKS
1,5 cups cake flour, less 2 tbsp
4 tbsp finely ground pistachios
2 tsp baking powder
1 cup raspberries
0,5tsp bicarbonate
2 tbsp sugar
0,5tsp salt
2 tbsp oil
2 large eggs
1,5 cups milk, plus a litte extra if needed
Sieve together all the dry ingredients. In a small bowl whisk together the oil, eggs and milk. Add this mixture to
the flour and without overworking it combine the two, if the batter is too heavy add a little extra milk.. Now stir
through the raspberries, reserving a few
To cook the pancakes, heat a non stick frying pan and add a little butter to it. Once the pan is hot add enough
batter to achieve the flapjack of the size and thickness you want, usually a 1/4 cup of batter gives a nice size
[MAKE SURE TO LIFT THE BATTER FROM THE BOTTOM AS THE RASPBERRIES WILL SINK, ENSURE EACH PANCAKE
GETS A FEW RASPBERRIES.
Once the batter starts to bubble it is time to turn the flapjack. Allow it to cook through, remove and keep warm
while you finish making the rest.
