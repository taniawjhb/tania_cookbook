CHICKEN & CORN SOUP
8 cups good-quality chicken stock or
vegetable stock, divided
3 cups diced or shredded cooked chicken
breasts*
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
4 green onions, thinly sliced with the white
and green parts divided
2 medium carrots, finely diced
1 (15-ounce) can whole kernel corn
1 (15 ounce) can creamed corn (or see
alternative below**)
1/4 cup cornstarch
6 large eggs, whisked
1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper
In a large stockpot, stir together 7 cups stock, chicken, ginger,
garlic powder, the white parts of the green onions, carrots, whole
kernel corn and creamed corn until combined.  Heat over
medium heat until the soup reaches a simmer.  Then reduce
heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for about 10 minutes, or
until the carrots have softened.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 cup stock
and cornstarch until combined.  Stir the mixture into the soup
and cook for 1 minute, or until the soup has thickened.
Using a spoon, begin to swirl the soup slowly in a continuous
motion.  Then while you are still swirling the soup, drizzle the
eggs into the soup in a steady stream.  The hot broth will
instantly cook the eggs, and they will form those beautiful egg
ribbons.
Add in the toasted sesame oil, and stir to combine.  Then taste
the soup, and season with salt and pepper as needed.
Serve warm, sprinkled with the remaining green parts of the
green onions.
