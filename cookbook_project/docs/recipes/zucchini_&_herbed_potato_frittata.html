zucchini & herbed potato frittata 
with parmesan shavings
12 large free range eggs
1 tsp chopped parsley
150gms grated parmesan cheese 80ml cream
salt & pepper to taste
1 red onion, finely chopped 
20 pattypan (mixed colours) 
generous knob of butter clove 
garlic crushed
sprig of thyme
salt & pepper to taste
1 tbsp olive oil
3 large potatoes
6 tbsp olive oil clove of garlic rosemary
To start, par boil the potatoes, before cutting them into small sized chunks.  Now heat the olive oil in a pan and 
add the rosemary and the clove of garlic.  Allow them to infuse before removing the garlic and rosemary and 
adding the boiled, drained and cut potatoes.  Fry the potatoes until crisp and well cooked, remove from the oil, 
season with salt and set aside.
To prepare the patty pan, start by cutting it into thin slices.  In a frying pan, the one you intend making the frittata 
in heat the butter, thyme and garlic.  As soon as it starts to sizzle add the finely chopped onion, cook until tender 
before adding the sliced patty pan.  Allow the patty pan to caramelise and develop colour before stirring and 
allowing to cook completely.  Once the patty pan is ready add in the cooked potato pieces, check seasoning and 
adjust, remember your parmesan will add extra saltiness.
Now in a bowl whisk together, eggs, parsley, salt & pepper, parmesan and cream, add it to the hot potato 
mixture.  Using a wooden spoon or spatula loosen the bottom slightly and allow thick pieces to form, before 
reducing the heat and allowing the bottom of the frittata to set completely.
To finish the frittata you can either loosen the bottom of the frittata once it has set, and carefully flip it over, and 
cook through or you can finish it under a hot grill in the oven.  To serve, garnish with some fresh herbs and finely 
shaved parmesan.
