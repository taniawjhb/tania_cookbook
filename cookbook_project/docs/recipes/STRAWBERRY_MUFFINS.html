STRAWBERRY MUFFINS
1 1/2 cups (195 grams) all-purpose flour
3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/3 cup (80 ml) vegetable oil
1 large egg
1/3 to 1/2 cup (80 ml – 120 ml) milk
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
180gms strawberries, hulled and diced (about
1 cup diced)
TOPPING
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
Heat the oven to 200C. Line 12 standard-size muffin cups with
paper liners.
Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and the cinnamonin a
large bowl until well mixed.
Using a measuring jug that holds at least 1 cup, measure out
the vegetable oil. Add the egg then fill the jug to the 1-cup line
with milk (this should be 1/3 to a 1/2 cup of milk). Add 1 1/2
teaspoons of vanilla extract and whisk until blended. Pour into
the bowl with flour and stir with a fork until just combined. Do
not over mix. Stir in the strawberries.
In a small bowl, stir 1 tablespoon of sugar with a 1/4 teaspoon
of vanilla then set aside.
Divide batter between the 12 muffin cups. (The batter will come
close to the tops of the paper liners). Lightly sprinkle vanilla sugar
topping over muffins.
Bake muffins until tops are golden brown, no longer wet and a
toothpick inserted into the middle comes out with crumbs, not
wet batter; 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and cool
completely.
