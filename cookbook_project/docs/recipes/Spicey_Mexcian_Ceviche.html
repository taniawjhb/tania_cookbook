Spicey Mexcian Ceviche
450gms fresh, skinless snapper, bass, halibut, or other ocean fish fillets, cut into 1/2-inch dice
1 1/2 cups fresh lime juice
1 medium white onion, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces
2 medium-large tomatoes (about 1 pound), chopped into 1/2-inch pieces
Fresh hot green chiles (2 to 3 serranos or 1 to 2 jalapeños), stemmed, seeded and finely chopped
1/3 cup chopped cilantro, plus a few leaves for garnish
1/3 cup chopped pitted green olives (manzanillos for a typical Mexican flavor)
1 to 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil (optional)
Salt
3 tablespoons fresh orange juice or 1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 large or 2 small ripe avocados, peeled, pitted and diced
Tostadas, tortilla chips or crostini for serving
In a large stainless steel bowl, combine the fish, lime juice and onion. Use enough juice to cover the fish
and allow it to float freely; too little juice means unevenly "cooked" fish.
Cover and refrigerate for about 4 hours, until a cube of fish no longer looks raw when broken open. Drain in
a colander.
In a large bowl, mix together the tomatoes, green chiles, cilantro, olives and optional olive oil. Stir in the fish
and season with salt, usually about 1/2 teaspoon. Add the sugar. Cover and refrigerate if not serving
immediately. Just before serving, gently stir in the diced avocado.
