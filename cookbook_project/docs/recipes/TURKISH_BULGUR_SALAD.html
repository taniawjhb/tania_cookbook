<pre>
2 cups Bulgur Wheat dry (I used Turkish
Bulgur)
3 cups boiling water
1/4 cup tomato paste
2 tablespoons roasted red pepper paste
1 tsp. Salt or more to taste
1/4 cup olive oil I used Turkish Olive Oil
1 cup cucumber diced
1 red bell pepper diced
3/4 cup green onion chopped
1/3 cup fresh parsley chopped
3/4 tsp. Cumin powder or 7 spice
1 lemon juiced
2 tbps. pomegranate molasses
1/3 cup purple onion optional
2 tablespoons Jalapeño Pepper optional if
you like spicy
TURKISH BULGUR SALAD
In a bowl, soak the bulgur with the boiling water for 20-30 minutes,
mixing occasionally until they are soft and tender. Bulgur should not
be chewy.
Meanwhile dice and chop all your ingredients.
In a frying pan bring the olive oil, salt, tomato and pepper paste to
simmer and keep cooking on low for about 5-7 minutes, stirring
occasionally to form a creamy tomato paste base. Turn off the heat.
Add in the bulgur and mix to coat well with the tomato paste. Allow
the bulgur to cool down for about 10 minutes.
In a bowl, add in all the salad ingredients with the bulgur,
pomegranate molasses, lemon juice and cumin. Taste to see if you
prefer to add more salt.
Serve right away or cool in the fridge to serve cold.
