4 CHEESE BAKED PASTA
250 g (elbow pasta)
1 tbsp unsalted butter
2/3 cup panko breadcrumbs
2 tbsp unsalted butter
1/4 tsp salt
60 g unsalted butter
1/3 cup plain flour (all purpose flour)
3-4 cups milk, warmed
200g grated cheese (cheddar/gruyere)
100g grated mozzarella cheese, or more other cheese of choice (Note 2)
3/4 tsp salt
Seasonings (optional):
½ tsp mustard powder
1 tsp black truffle paste
100gm pancetta, cut into cubes, and dry fried until crispy
Preheat oven to 180C/350F.
Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Add macaroni and cook per packet directions MINUS 1 minute.
Drain, return pasta to pot, add butter and toss until melted. Set aside to cool while making the Sauce
Mix together Topping. Set aside.
In a large saucepan or in an ovenproof skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add flour and cook, stirring
constantly, for 1 minute.
Add about 1 cup of the milk and mix to dissolve the paste into the milk. Then add remaining milk and mix
until lump free (use whisk if required).
Mix in salt and Seasonings if using.
Cook, stirring/whisking regularly, for 5 - 8 minutes until thickened to a cream consistency. When the Sauce
coats the back of a wooden spoon, you should be able to draw a path with your finger.
Remove from stove, add the crisp pancetta pieces, truffle paste and cheese and stir - the cheese doesn't
need to melt. Taste and adjust salt to taste.
Pour Sauce into pot with Macaroni. Stir quickly, then pour back into the skillet or a baking dish. Sprinkle with
breadcrumb topping.
