<pre>
4 large egg yolks
3/4 cup granulated sugar 
2 cups whole milk
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla 
extract
240gms mascarpone
Step 1:  In a medium saucepan, whisk together the egg yolks 
and sugar until smooth, thick, and pale yellow. This will take 
around 30 seconds. Whisk in the milk, cream, salt and vanilla 
until evenly combined.
Step 2:  Place the saucepan over medium heat. Whisking 
almost constantly, cook the mixture until an instant-read 
thermometer reads 170 degrees F, approximately 10 minutes.
Step 3:  Place the mascarpone cheese in a medium-sized bowl. 
Carefully add one or two ladles of the hot gelato base and 
whisk until smooth. Continue adding the hot liquid and 
whisking until the mascarpone is completely incorporated.
Step 4:   Strain the gelato base through a fine mesh strainer into 
a medium-size bowl, preferably one with a pouring spout.
Step 5:   Place plastic wrap directly against the surface of the 
liquid to prevent a skin from forming. Chill until the mixture is 
very cold, at least 6 hours or up to two days in advance.
Step 6:   Briefly whisk the mixture, then prepare in an ice cream 
maker according to manufacturer instructions.
Step 7:   Once the gelato has finished spinning, it will likely be a 
soft serve consistency. Transfer to a loaf pan (or similar sized 
pan), cover, and freeze until fully frozen but scoopable, up to 2 
hours.
