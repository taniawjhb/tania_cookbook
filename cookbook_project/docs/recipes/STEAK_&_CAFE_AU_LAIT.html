STEAK & CAFE AU LAIT 
SAUCE
3 Tbsp (45 ml), medium ground coffee beans 
2 Tbsp (30 ml) sea salt
1 Tbsp (15 ml) paprika
1 Tbsp (15 ml) brown sugar
1 Tbsp (15 ml) ground garlic
1 Tbsp (15 ml) onion powder
1 Tbsp (15 ml) mustard powder
1 Tbsp (15 ml) cumin
1-2 tsp (5-10 ml) chilli powder
1 tsp (5 ml) black pepper
Sunflower oil
4 x 250 g centre cut fillet steaks 
a big knob of butter
2 garlic cloves, whole but squashed 
a big spring of thyme
Mix the rub ingredients together well set aside until ready to use.
Add the cream and ground coffee to a small saucepan over medium heat and stir to combine. Bring the 
cream to a boil and then simmer for 1 minute before removing from the heat. Allow the cream to infuse for 15 
minutes then strain the cream through a very fine sieve or a piece of muslin cloth. Set the coffee cream aside until 
ready to use.
Melt the butter in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat. Fry the mushrooms for 3-4 minutes until 
golden brown, then remove the mushrooms from the pan a set aside.
Add the coffee cream and stock to the pan and bring to a boil. Simmer for a 5-7 minutes to reduce and 
thicken.  Then add the mushrooms, thyme and chives to the cream and stir gently to combine. Season with salt 
and pepper and turn off the heat. Reheat the sauce when you are ready to serve your steaks.
Pat the fillet steaks dry and then season with coffee rub. Drizzle with canola oil and set aside.
Heat a large cast iron pan over high heat until the pan begins to smoke. Carefully place the oiled steaks 
into the pan and cook for 1 minute. Flip the steaks and cook for another minute then add the butter, thyme and 
garlic.
Carefully tilt the pan and baste the steaks with the foaming, melted butter. Continue cooking the steaks 
for 1 minute a side and basting with every flip for a total of 3-4 minutes a side depending on how you like your 
steak.
Rest the steaks for at least 10-minutes, then serve with warm café au lait mushroom sauce.
