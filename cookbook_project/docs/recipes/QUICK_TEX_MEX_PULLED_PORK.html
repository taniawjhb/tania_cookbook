QUICK TEX MEX PULLED PORK
3 teaspoons vegetable oil
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 small onion, chopped
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1/3 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons molasses
1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon apple cider
vinegar
1 pork tenderloin (about 1 pound), cut into 4
pieces
1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard
In a large Dutch oven, heat 2 teaspoons of the oil over medium
heat. Add the garlic and onion and season with salt and
pepper. Cook until softened and lightly browned, about 5
minutes.
Add the chili powder, cumin, cinnamon and cayenne and cook
until toasted, 1 minute more. Stir in the chicken broth, ketchup,
molasses and 1/3 cup of the vinegar. Bring to a simmer and
add the pork. Simmer, covered, until the pork is just cooked
through and tender, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk the mustard with the
remaining 1 teaspoon oil and 1 tablespoon vinegar in a large
bowl. Add the broccoli slaw and toss well. Season with salt and
pepper and set aside.
Remove the pork to a cutting board and let stand for 5 minutes.
Increase the heat under the Dutch oven to medium high and
cook the sauce until thickened, about 5 minutes.
Shred the pork with 2 forks into large chunks and return to the
thickened sauce. Toss well to coat and simmer 10 minutes,
tossing occasionally, to let the pork absorb the sauce. Serve on
the buns with the slaw on the sandwiches or on the side.
