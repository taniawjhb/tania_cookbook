Banana Upside Down Cake
300gms caster sugar
5 ripe bananas
1/4 tsp cinnamon
140gms soft unsalted butter 
180gms plain cake flour
1 1/2 tsp baking powder 
1tsp ground cinnamon
4 eggs, separated
140gms caster sugar
2 large ripe bananas, peeled and mashed
Preheat the oven to 170C
Generously butter the bas and side of a heavy based 23cm spring form tin, the line it with baking paper
To make the banana caramel, put the sugar and 150ml water in a heavy based saucepan and cook over a high heat until 
the sugar has dissolved.  Let it boil until thickened to a golden brown caramel, pour it into the cake tin, tipping slightly from 
side to side until evenly coated.
Peel the bananas and cut them in half lengthways, arrange them over the caramel in a nice pattern, trimming any extra if 
need be.  Now dust with the ground cinnamon
TO make the cake batter, sift together the flour, baking powder and cinnamon into a large bowl.  Put the egg whites in a 
seperate clean bowl and whisk until stiff peaks form.  Put the butter and sugar in the bowl of a mixer and whisk until light 
and fluffy.  Slowly whisk in the egg yolks one at a time.  Then fold in the mashed bananas followed by the dry ingredients. 
Once combined, fold in the stiff egg whites.
Pour the batter into the tin and spread evenly with a spatula. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the 
centre comes out cleanly.
Remove and leave to cool for a few minutes before unmolding.  Be careful when unmolding the caramel will be warm.
