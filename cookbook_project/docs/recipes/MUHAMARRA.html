<pre>
For the dip
2 red bell peppers
4 tablespoon Extra Virgin Olive Oil 
divided
125g shelled toasted walnuts
1 garlic clove roughly chopped
2 ½ tablespoon tomato paste
¾ cup bread crumbs
2 tablespoon pomegranate molasses
1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper
½ teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon sumac
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon cayenne pepper optional
Instructions
Step 1:  Preheat the oven to 220C.
Step 2:  Brush the bell peppers with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 
and place in a lightly oiled oven-safe pan or cast-iron skillet. 
Roast the peppers in the 220C heated oven for 30 minutes or 
so, turning them over once or twice.
Step 3:  Remove from the oven and place the peppers in a 
bowl. Cover with plastic wrap for a few minutes. This traps the 
steam from the roasted peppers, making them easy to peel. 
When cool enough to handle, simply peel the peppers, 
remove the seeds and slice the peppers into small strips.
Step 4:  Now in the bowl of a large food processor, combine 
the roasted red pepper strips with 3 tablespoon extra virgin 
olive oil, garlic, walnuts, tomato paste, bread crumbs, 
pomegranate molasses, Aleppo pepper, sugar, sumac, salt 
and cayenne. Blend into a smooth paste.
Step 5:  Transfer to a serving bowl. You may cover the 
muhammara and refrigerate, but be sure to bring the dip to 
room temperature before serving.
