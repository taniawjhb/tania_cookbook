CHICKEN CACCIATORE 
THE HUNTERS CHICKEN
INGREDIENTS
4 bone in chicken thighs large (1 kg / 2 lb)
4 chicken drumsticks
1/2 tsp salt
Large pinch tsp black pepper
1 tbsp olive oil
Cacciatore:
1 onion , halved, finely sliced
2 rosemary sprigs (about 15 cm/6″ long), or 1 
tsp dried rosemary
2 bay leaves , preferably fresh else dried
3 garlic cloves , finely minced
3 anchovy fillets (or 1 tsp anchovy paste), 
optional 
250g / 8 oz mushrooms , sliced
2 medium red peppers or 1 large red pepper, 
sliced 8 mm thick (medium, not giant)
90 g tomato paste
180 ml dry red wine
500 ml chicken stock/broth , low sodium
400g/14 oz canned crushed tomato
16 whole kalamata olives , pitted, drained
1/4 tsp cooking/kosher salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
1 tsp dried oregano
METHOD
1. Season – Spread the chicken out on a tray. 
Sprinkle both sides with the salt and pepper.  Heat 
the oil over high heat in a large, deep, heavy based 
pan, preferably one with a lid. Place the chicken 
thighs in the pan, skin side down, and cook until the 
skin is golden brown, around 6 minutes. Turn and 
cook the flesh side for just 1 minute, then remove 
the chicken onto the same tray. Repeat until all 
chicken is browned. Remove onto the tray.
Step 1:  Turn the heat down to medium and let the 
pan cool slightly. Add the onion, rosemary leaves, 
bay leaves and dried oregano. Cook for 3 minutes 
until the onion is starting to soften.
Step 2:  Clear a space in the middle of the pan. Add 
the anchovies and garlic, cooking, mashing up the 
anchovies, until the garlic is light golden, then stir it 
into the onion.
Step 3:  Turn the heat back up to high. Add the 
mushroom and capsicum. Stir until softened – about 
5 minutes (the mushrooms will go watery then the 
water will evaporate). Add the tomato paste and 
cook for 2 minutes to cook out the sour flavour – do 
not shortcut this.
Step 4:  Add the wine. Stir, bring to simmer then 
allow to reduce by around 75%. Add the stock, 
canned tomato, salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a 
simmer.
Step 5:  Simmer – Then carefully place the chicken 
into the sauce (skin side up) and pour any juices on 
the tray in as well. When the liquid returns to a 
simmer, cover, reduce the heat to medium then 
simmer energetically for 20 minutes. Remove lid, add 
olives, simmer for a further 10 minutes (no lid). This 
will reduce and thicken the sauce.
Serve – Serve the chicken with plenty of sauce over 
mashed potato or polenta, sprinkled with parsley if 
desired.
