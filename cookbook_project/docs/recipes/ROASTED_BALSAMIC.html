ROASTED BALSAMIC
TOMATO & THYME GALETTE
For the galette dough
Step 1:  Mix together the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl.
Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, cut in the cubes of butter
until they are crumbly and pea-sized.
Step 2:  Mix in the ice-cold water one tablespoon at a time,
stirring with a wooden spoon until a cohesive ball of dough
forms. The dough will still be slightly crumbly, that's okay. Wrap
tightly in plastic wrap and let rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 220C.
For the cherry tomato filling:
Step 1:  Meanwhile, prep the filling. Roughly chop the garlic.
Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Add the
garlic, cherry tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, thyme, and salt.
Saute just until the cherry tomatoes burst, about 8-10 minutes,
stirring frequently. Set aside.
To assemble the galette
Step 1:  On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry dough
into a 12-inch circle. Place on a parchment paper lined sheet
pan or on a preheated pizza stone.
Step 2:  Pour the cherry tomato filling into the center of the
galette, leaving about 2 inches of a border. Fold the border in
over just the edges of the cherry tomatoes
Step 3:  Bake for 25-30 minutes at 220C on the middle oven
rack, until the galette is golden brown. Remove the galette
from the oven and allow to cool for 10 to 15 minutes before
cutting.
