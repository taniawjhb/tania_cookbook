The Colony Shopping Centre, 345 Jan Smuts Avenue, Craighall, 2024.
Chickpeas & Spinach
500g chickpeas in brine
300 grams fresh spinach, washed
2 thick slices of day old bread (sourdough works well) with crusts removed and cut into cubes 
15 blanched unsalted almonds
¼ cup tomato sauce
3 garlic cloves, chopped 
Extra virgin olive oil
2 Tablespoons Sherry vinegar (or red wine vinegar if sherry vinegar is hard to come by)
1 teaspoon ground cumin
Ground cayenne pepper (to taste) 
Salt
Black pepper (to taste)
Smoked Spanish paprika (I use pimentón dulce, but you could also use pimentón picante)
Coat a large saucepan with extra virgin olive oil (approx. 2 T) and heat to medium high.  Before the oil gets too hot, add the 
spinach (in batches if necessary).  Sauté the spinach until just wilted and remove to strain in a colander
Re-coat the pan with olive oil and add in the bread cubes and raw almonds. Fry until the bread and almonds are browned 
and crispy on each side
Add the chopped garlic, cumin, cayenne and black pepper and sauté for a couple of minutes, until the garlic is fragrant and 
turning brown.  Transfer the ingredients to a blender/food processor and add the sherry vinegar
Blend the ingredients together until you have a thick paste (don't over blend and make it gooey).  Return the paste to the 
saucepan and add your chick peas and tomato sauce.  Stir gently until the chickpeas are fully coated by the sauce and add 
a bit of water to thin things out
Add the spinach and stir gently until it is evenly incorporated and hot Season with salt and pepper
Once plated, drizzle a swirl of extra virgin olive oil on top of each dish, then sprinkle a small amount of smoked Spanish 
paprika on top
Enjoy!
