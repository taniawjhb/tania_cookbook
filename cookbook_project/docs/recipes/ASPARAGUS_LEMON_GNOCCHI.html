<pre>
⅔ cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 large bunch asparagus, trimmed, thinly sliced
on a deep diagonal
4 garlic cloves, smashed
1 cup fresh cream
4 3"-long strips lemon zest
½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
8 large basil leaves
2 lemons, halved
2 oz. Parmesan, finely grated (about 1 cup), plus
more for serving
Cook gnocchi in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring
occasionally, until al dente. Drain gnocchi, reserving 1½ cups pasta
cooking liquid.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over
medium-high until shimmering. Add asparagus, season with salt,
and cook, stirring often, until just beginning to take on color, about 1
minute.
Add garlic, lemon zest, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring,
until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Add 1/2 cup stock and basil to pot with asparagus mixture and
return to medium-high heat. Squeeze juice from both lemons into
pot and add 60gms Parmesan and 1/4 reserved gnocchi cooking
liquid.
Cook, tossing vigorously, but gently, after 1 minute add the cream
stir until the sauce is well combined and emulsified and pasta is
coated, about 1 minute. Taste and season with more salt if needed.
Remove and discard garlic. Add the cooked gnocchi and stir gently
to coat, if needed add a small splash of water
Divide pasta among bowls, placing a lemon strip in each, and top
with more Parmesan.
