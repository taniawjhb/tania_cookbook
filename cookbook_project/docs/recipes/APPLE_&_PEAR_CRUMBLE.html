APPLE & PEAR CRUMBLE 
INGREDIENTS
500g apple peeled, cored and cut into large 
chunks
1 lemon zested 
1/2 lemon juiced
2 tbsp light muscovado sugar
500g pear peeled, cored and cut into large 
chunks
For the crumble topping
100g pack walnut
175g plain cake flour
85g butter, diced
85g caster or light muscovado sugar
METHOD
1.  Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Put the chopped 
apples, lemon zest,  and sugar in a saucepan. Add the 
lemon juice and cook for 3-4 mins. Tip in the pears and 
cook 2-3 mins more, until the fruits are just beginning 
to soften. Spoon the fruits and juices into a 1.7 litre 
pudding dish and flatten slightly.
2.  For the crumble, finely chop half the walnuts in a 
food processor until reduced to the consistency of 
ground almonds. Add the flour, butter and sugar and 
continue to blitz to a coarse or fine crumble mix, 
whichever you prefer.
3.  Roughly break the remaining walnuts with your 
fingers and stir into the crumble. Scatter the crumble 
mix on top of the fruits and bake for 20-25 mins until 
golden brown. Serve warm with cream or custard.
