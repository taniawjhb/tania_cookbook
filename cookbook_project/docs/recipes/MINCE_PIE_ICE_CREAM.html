MINCE PIE ICE CREAM
2 cups heavy whipping cream
1 3/4 cup full cream milk
225g white sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 cinnammon stick
4 store bought mince pies
5 egg yolks
3 whole cloves
Combine heavy cream, milk, sugar, and spices in a
saucepan; bring to a simmer over low heat. Cook and stir until
sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Cover
saucepan and allow the mixture to steep for 10 minutes.
Uncover pan and bring back to a simmer over low heat. Beat the
egg yolks in a bowl. Gradually stir one cup of the hot cream
mixture into the eggs, several tablespoons at a time. This will
help to bring the eggs up to temperature without scrambling
them.
Stir the egg mixture back into the cream mixture in the
saucepan. Cook and stir over low heat until the mixture just
coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a large
bowl; cover. Refrigerate overnight.
Once ice cold, freeze according to your icecream 
Manufacturer's directions, once almost stir through the 
pieces of broken up mince pie
Transfer ice cream to a lidded freezer container, and
freeze for 4 hours to ripen flavors before serving.
