ETHIOPIAN DORO WAT
4 medium-sized red onions
1.6kg chicken
3/4 to 1 cup Vegetable oil or any good cook-
ing oil of your choice
2 tablespoon kibbeh Ethiopian spiced butter
2 tablespoons tomato paste optional
6 eggs hard-boiled
2 tbsp minced garlic
2 tbsp grated ginger
1/4 cup water
salt to taste
1/2 cup of berbere spice
1 cup vinegar and 2 cups water to clean
chicken
Clean the chicken very well and soak it in water and vinegar.
Rinse and drain when ready to use.
Boil the eggs, peel, and set aside.
Finely dice the onions. Use a food processor to save time.
Add the onions to a pot over low to medium heat. The onions
will sweat and create the water they will simmer in. Continue to
stir the onions to prevent burning until they change color (light
pink color). About 30 to 40 minutes. When they are done, the
water will evaporate, and the onions will begin to stick to the
bottom of the pot.
Stir in the oil, minced garlic, salt, and berbere spice. Stir well.
Add the butter and the tomato paste and stir.
Slash the chicken in two or three places. This step is optional, but
it will allow the flavors of the stew to penetrate the chicken. Add
the chicken inside the stew and stir.
Add the water and cook on medium heat for 30 to 40 minutes
stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Continue to cook until the
stew thickens up and the chicken becomes ender.
Stir in the eggs and leave to cook for another 15 to 20 minutes.
