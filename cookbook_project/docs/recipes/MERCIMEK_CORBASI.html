MERCIMEK CORBASI
INGREDIENTS
5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, chopped
3 garlic cloves, minced, divided
2 to 3 carrots, peeled and chopped
1 medium russet potato, peeled and small 
diced or chopped
Kosher salt
2 tablespoons tomato paste
6 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper, divided
1 teaspoon cumin
½ teaspoon coriander
1 cup red lentils, picked over and rinsed
1 large lemon, cut into wedges
METHOD
In a large Dutch oven or cooking pot, heat 2 
tablespoons extra virgin olive oil over medium-high 
heat until shimmering.
Add the onions, 2 minced garlic cloves, carrots, and 
potatoes. Season with a good dash of kosher salt, 
and cook, stirring occasionally until the vegetables 
have softened (about 5 to 7 minutes).
Add the tomato paste and toss to coat the 
vegetables with the paste, then add the broth 1 
teaspoon of Aleppo-style pepper and the rest of the 
spices.
Add the lentils and stir.
Allow the soup to come to a rolling boil for 4 to 5 
minutes, then lower the heat and cover the Dutch 
oven with the lid leaving a small opening.
Let the soup simmer on the lowest heat setting for 
about 15 to 20 minutes or until the lentils and the 
vegetables are completely tender. (Check 
occasionally and give the soup a stir as needed. If it 
is getting too thick, add a little bit more vegetable 
broth about ½ to 1 cup more).
Remove the pot from the heat and carefully blend the 
soup using an immersion blender until smooth and 
creamy. (Alternatively, transfer the soup to a standard 
blender, let some of the steam escape. Blend in 
batches until all of the soup is smooth.)
To finish, in a small skillet, warm about 3 tablespoons 
extra virgin olive oil over medium heat. Add the 
remaining Aleppo pepper and minced garlic and 
cook briefly until the garlic is golden brown and the 
oil has taken on a red hue from the Aleppo pepper. 
Remove from the heat and pour the warmed oil all 
over the soup.
Serve with lemon wedges to the side.
